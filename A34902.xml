            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:65303:5"/> down to us, to be the hope of Glory in us, He cometh with Garments rolled in Blood; to make us know what we coſt him; and through theſe Garments, Eternal, and overcoming love ſhineth, warmeth, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracteth the hearts of Believers. 2. Chriſt cometh in this Ordinance, to give Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers a hearty taſte, of that intimate Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion which ſhall hereafter be the fulneſs of their joy, their Crown, and their Glory: and though now they ſee him but darkly, yet they know it to be himſelf, and not another; and when he and they ſhall meet again in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother manner, when he ſhal come to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them without a Vail on his glorious Face, they ſhall know it's the ſame bleſſed Face which they beheld before, but as in a Glaſs. How ſweet to think on that meeting with Hope? Where the hope is ſure, as an Anchor already entred within the vail: at the firſt Celebration Chriſt willed the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants to raiſe up their hearts, to the Meditations, and joyful Expectations of that bleſſed Communion to come, by putting them in mind, that he and they ſhal drink together of the new Wine in his Fathers
<pb facs="tcp:65303:6"/> Kingdom. 3. Believers admitted to true Communion with him in this Ordinance, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive with himſelf; grace to love his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip, grace to hate what offereth to ſepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at, grace to love the means of its continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, grace to long for its perfection: when he who is full of grace and truth comes near to a poor ſinner, the ſavour of his Oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments goeth to the poor mans heart, Chriſt bringeth him near, not that he may look at him, and get nothing, but look and be ſaved, behold and be transformed into the ſame image, eat and be ſatisfied: Chriſt's fulneſs of Grace overfloweth, yielding ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Bleſſings to the dry and parched Ground; we cannot ſo much as touch him by Faith, but vertue proceedeth for heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the poor ſinner. 4. Here alſo is the Seal of Christ's Teſtament, ſecuring the Believer he ſhal be preſerved unto the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Kingdom, and be forever witb the Lord: he hath given himſelf to them, and they bave received him; Therefore now no Sin, no Death, no Devil, no enſnar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing World, nothing preſent or to come, ſhall ſeparate from his Love. The believing Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver
<pb facs="tcp:65303:6"/> may, and ſhould conclude this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the honour and regard that is due to Chriſt's Seal, and therefore together with dependance on the Spirits ſealing, the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever is not to be idle, waiting only if aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance will drop down upon him, but is to endeavour the aſſuring of his own heart by the Seal of God.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, the danger is great, if this Ordinance be profaned: for the more of Chriſt's Love ſhine in any Ordinance, &amp; the nearer he cometh with the offers of his Love, the more heinous is the profana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Now of all Goſpel Ordinances, Christ offereth to come neareſt to us in the Lords Supper; preaching is to bring us near to Christ; but in the Lords Supper the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever directly acteth Communion with Chriſt: and therefore this Ordinance doth in a peculiar manner bear this name of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. There is no cauſe then of judging it great ſeverity, when it's ſaid he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh Damnation or Judgement to himſelf: ſome are ready to ſay; theſe
<pb facs="tcp:65303:7"/> were monſters of men, who imbrued their vile hands in that precious Blood, &amp; they would not have been guilty of it for all the Kingdoms of the Earth; who yet forget that the Lord chargeth the ſame guilt on themſelves, for profaneing that holy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance being thereby guilty of the Body and Blood of the Lord.</p>
            <p>The danger of this hath made me inſiſt the more largely on that head of Self-examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before partaking at the Lords Table; which perhaps ſome may think tedious, but if it may conduce as a mean, to prevent the guilt of one poor ſoul I ſhall not think any pains too much: as for others who find no need of ſo many and particular Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, they may paſs them by, and leave them to others.</p>
            <p>Some may be apt to Object the ſame a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſo long diſcourſing on Communion with God: but whoſoever Objecteth this, let him Conſider. <hi>Firſt,</hi> That Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Chriſt is the very Text and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:65303:7"/> with God; how ſhall they ſeek after it in the Sacrament. 3. If true Communion with Chriſt be obtained at the Lord'<hi>s</hi> Table, then it ought to be Cheriſhed and Entertained in a Believers Walk, for Christ being Received we are to Walk in Him: It were great Ignorance if not Ir-religious profaneneſs, to ſay that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Chriſt being Obtained at His Table, we are to be no more concerned with it until the next Communion; for ſuch as are of this Opinion have juſt cauſe of Fear they never yet had Communion with Chriſt any where. 4 The very Happineſs of men conſiſting in Communion with God, this being the Believers only help and Comfort, &amp; it's interruptions his great loſs, grief &amp; diſquiet, finding that without it he is as nothing, &amp; for nothing but evil, I therefore wiſh this little hint of it may be ſerviceable were it for no more, but to excite others better Qualified, &amp; Bleſſed with more experience, to write on this Subject of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God by it ſelf, in a more full and particular manner than I have yet ſeen, or ſuch a weak Perſon as I am able to perform.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:65303:8"/>
            <p>Some alſo will probally Object againſt the many Objections here Publiſhed, eſpecially theſe Temptations mentioned, that it might be Prudence rather to conceal ſome of them, To which I anſwered. <hi>Firſt, That many Horrid Temptations are Recorded in the Holy Scriptures, as alſo the Mercy of God's delivering from them Publiſhed to His Glory;</hi> Therefore His Gracious ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port under ſuch Temptations, and grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing frequently a Comfortable Victorie is not to be concealed. 2. It's neceſſary that People be Warned and Armed for the worſt of Temptations, that ſo they may be fixed by the Armour of God, before they be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted. 3. Many conceal their Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions too long, until they are ready to ſink, and are ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:65303:8"/> more Publick conſideration, becauſe ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed Souls under grievous Temptations and Suggeſtions, are more Numerous than is commonly Apprehended: and theſe not only of our Perſwaſſion, for I can give Inſtances of ſeveral ſober Perſons now living, and of another Perſwaſſion Afflicted in like manner. 5. Let it be Conſidered, that their is nothing in the following Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe for Indulging any manner of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations, but what is ſaid is to reſiſt them in a Chriſtian manner.</p>
            <p>The laſt thing I am to acquaint thee with, is, that this little Treatiſe being wholy practical, and deſigned only to for help to the weaker ſort of Chriſtians, it's ſtile is fitted for the meaneſt, for though Controverſies cannot be Mannaged with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out words dificult to the Ignorant; yet it hath ſometimes grieved Me to ſee ſome Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent practical Books Thrown away by ſome Readers, for no other Reaſon, but that the Words were above their reach; which I Humbly Conceive ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientiouſly prevented, for knowing Readers

               <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Ommunion with God is juſtly the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of all that obtain it, who can do little more while here but wonder, not underſtanding it's value, untill the ſhaddows flee away, and they ſee His Face in a greater brightneſs; This dignity and mercy muſt be exceeding great, ſeing the blood of him who is God was ſhed for it's Purchaſe, <hi>The juſt ſuffering for the unjuſt, to bring us to God, 1 Pet.</hi> 3. 18. But when his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants ſhal ſerve him, and ſee his Face, and thereby them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves be made to ſhine in their Fathers Kingdom, then ſhal the glory of that love which contrived, and the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of that love which purchaſed this Communion, be celebrated in another manner: Yet this Communion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing begun on earth, we muſt according to the meaſure given, aim at the celebration of the glory of this love, in the manner required by himſelf, who hath inſtituted this Sacrament of the Lords Supper for a memorial of his love, in humbling himſelf unto death; requiring this his death to be ſhewed forth until he come again, and allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his people ſuch Communion with himſelf in this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, as ſhal be to them a Seal for their eternal Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of him, when he cometh again to receive them to himſelf.</p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:65303:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>The Bleſſings of this Ordinance are ſo great; that it's our mercy we have it's inſtitution, it's ſeveral Parts the ſignification of each Part<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Manner of acting on our part, &amp; the Benefits to the believing Receiver. All particul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly recorded. And in the words of this Text we have all theſe bleſſings ſummed up in our obtaining Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Chriſt, for he being ours, all is ours.</p>
            <p>The Connexion of this <hi>verſe</hi> with the words immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately proceeding is not ſo very obvious, as the Scope will make it appear, for what end the Lords Supper is here mentioned.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle is giving ſeaſonable warning to theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving <hi>Corinthians,</hi> now eminent for Gifts, to take heed leſt they fall, <hi>verſe</hi> 12. For which end he gives them to underſtand that the people of God of old, were priviledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed above all other People, with ſignal teſtimonies of Gods peculiar favour, <hi>they were under the cloud,</hi> miraculouſly carried through the red ſea, did eat the ſame ſpiritual meat, and drink the ſame ſpiritual drink: And all theſe mercies by Chriſt the Rock that followed them; Yet with many of them God was not well pleaſed: And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other evils whereby God was provoked, their early Idolatry was moſt provoking: Therefore ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>flee from Idolatry,</hi> ver. 14. and propoſeth this Text as an Argument againſt Participation with Idolaters, in their idolatrous ſervice; For ſaith he ye have ſolemnly profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Chriſt, and Communion with him, in the Sacrament of his Supper; and therefore muſt renounce all Worſhip, that's inconſiſtent with the ſaid Profeſſion, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion; ſuch as the Sacrifices of the Gentiles being but Sacrifices of Devils, <hi>&amp;c. And ye cannot drink of the Cup of the Lord, and the Cup of Devils,</hi> ver. 21. Now that this Ordinance is ſuch a ſolemn profeſſed Communion with Chriſt, he aſſerteth as undenyable by this interrogation is it not, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Making the Affirmative ſtrong, being ſuch as themſelves could not deny.</p>
            <p>In the words we have theſe four things. Firſt the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral nature of this holy Sacrament, that is, the ſigns of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Inſtitution, and the promiſed Bleſſing thereto Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining. 2. Both the ſigns diſtinctly diſcribed, and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65303:11"/> both to be made uſe of by Believers. 3. The ſpecial and great benefit of Communion with Chriſt repreſented by theſe Symbols. 4. That in order to a Believers partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of Chriſts Body and Blood, theſe viſible ſigns muſt be bleſſed and ſet apart for that holy uſe, the Apoſtle here beginneth with the Cup, where we are to conſider four things, Firſt what is underſtood by the Cup, Secondly, How it's called a Cup of Bleſſing, Thirdly, How it's ſaid to be the Cup which we bleſs, Fourthly, That the Cup Bleſſed is the Communion of the blood of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>For the Firſt, the Cup ſignifieth the Wine in the Cup, and the Wine repreſenteth Chriſts Blood; and therefore evidently a figurative ſpeech, <hi>Mat. 26. 27. And he took the Cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, ſaying, drink ye all of it, for this is my blood of the New Teſtament,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>Luke 22. 20. This Cup is the New Teſtament in my blood.</hi> So that by the Cup is ſet forth the precious blood of Chriſt the price of our Redemption, <hi>Epheſ. 1. 7. In whom we have redemption through his blood,</hi> and 1 <hi>Cor. 6. 20. Ye are bought with a price.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> It's the Cup of Bleſſing; being indeed a Cup of Salvation, full of bleſſings to the believing Receiver, being bleſſed with all ſpiritual bleſſings in Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 3. The curſed made bleſſed, &amp; the guilty made righteous. Next, It's the cup of Bleſſings or Praiſes, the word alſo ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing giving thanks, for hereby the bleſſings of many rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to periſh come upon the Redeemer, who loved and gave himſelf for them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It's the Cup which we bleſs, the cup muſt be bleſſed, and ſet apart for repreſenting of that precious blood: Therefore we find that Chriſt bleſſed it; <hi>He took the cup, and gave thanks;</hi> the benefit of which is yet to be expected by Believers. Secondly, and his ſervants by Office, who in his Name adminiſter this Ordinance, and give the Cup, pray for this bleſſing, and in his Name bleſs and ſet apart the Cup for this ſacred uſe, that it may be to the partakers by Chriſts bleſſing the Communion of his Blood; which is,</p>
            <p>The fourth thing to be conſidered. The Communion of his Blood: The word ſignifieth Common or Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65303:12"/> to others giving and receiving, as 1 <hi>Tim. 6. 18. wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to Communicate;</hi> It's the ſame word, So there is giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on Chriſts part, and receiving by the Believer which is this Communion of his Blood; ſo the ſame word is tranſlated fellowſhip, 1 <hi>Cor. 1. 9: You are called unto the fellowſhip of his Son, Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> Believers having moſt intimate fellowſhip with Chriſt, they in him, and Chriſt dwelling in their hearts by Faith, So the word is alſo tranſlated Partaking, 2 <hi>Pet, 1. 4. That by theſe you might be partakers of the Divine nature,</hi> that is to have Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the Divine nature: and poſſibly it had been as ſafe to have tranſlated its Communion or Fellowſhip, as partaking, for ſome weak people have miſtaken that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion (partaking of the Divine nature) and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtretched it, to whom fellowſhip with the Divine Nature had been more plain, as the word is tranſlated<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1 <hi>John 1: 3. Our fellowſhip is with the Father, and his Son Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The Cup here is ſaid to be the Communion of his blood, that is the Cup being bleſſed according to Divine Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and made uſe of by the believing Receiver, he par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes of the benefit of Chriſt's blood, his Death and Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe, he hath Communion with Chriſt crucified, his Death being for him, and in his ſtead; he is ſaid to be crucified with Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 20: ſatisfying the Juſtice of God, in and by Chriſt crucified, and ſo hath the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of his blood.</p>
            <p>The next viſible ſign is the Bread, where theſe three things are to be noted, firſt, that it's bread, Secondly, Bread broken, and Thirdly, that this Bread broken is the Communion of Chriſts Body.</p>
            <p>For the firſt Bread is made uſe of by our Redeemer, as that which is neceſſary for preſerving the life of man, and therefore fit to ſignifie, and repreſent the Bread of life, Chriſt is our ſpiritual food, his fleſh meat indeed <hi>John 6: 55: Secondly,</hi> It's not any bread but this bread bleſſed and ſet apart for this repreſentation, <hi>Mat. 26: 26: As they were eating, Jeſus took bread and bleſſed it, Thirdly,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it's bleſſed, it remaineth ſtill bread, the Apoſtle doth not ſay the Body which we break, but the Bread which we break; now the Bread is not broken before, but after
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65303:12"/> it's bleſſed, <hi>for he took bread and bleſsed it, and brake,</hi> and the Apoſtle ſaith expreſly it's Bread which is broken! but if after the bleſſing or conſecration, the bread were tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiated into the natural Body of Chriſt, then the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle had ſaid the Body which we break: ſure the Apoſtle knew what name to give it, having received of the Lord what he delivereth, and what can be more plain, than that it's ſtill Bread when it's broken, which is after it's conſecration; this breaking of the bread is ſo material a part of the inſtitution, that the whole of the Sacrament bears its name called the breaking of bread, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 42. The breaking of Chriſts precious Body being thereby ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified, Chriſt requireth this diſcerning of his Body, brok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en ſaying, <hi>this is my body which is broken for you, 1 Cor.</hi> 11: 24: and the breaking of the bread muſt be Sacramentally, and publlckly performed in ſight of the Communicants, for their inſtruction, as in the firſt Celebration.</p>
            <p>And in the laſt place, the ſincere Believer in eating of this bread according to Chriſt's inſtitution, doth by Faith receive himſelf, hath ſpecial Communion with him, and partakes the benefits and purchaſe made through the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of the body of Jeſus Chriſt once for all, <hi>Heb:</hi> 10: 10: This is the Sacrifice he came to give, when no other could do; and therefore it's memorial ſhould be always fragrant.</p>
            <p>Many pertinent Doctrines may be here obſerved, both from the ſcope and words of this Text, but I ſhal name only this one.</p>
            <p>Doct. <hi>The worthy receiver at the Lords Table hath Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Chriſt, in partaking the benefit of his precious blood, and broken Body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From this great and comfortable truth, theſe ten in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences following appear native, which ſhal be the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject matter, of the enſuing Diſcourſe, Firſt inference the celebration of the Lords Supper, being an holy tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action between Chriſt and Believers, wherein they have the Communion of his Body and blood, then the Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine of Chriſt concerning himſelf, what he is, what he hath done and ſuffered, ſhould be firmly believed as a foundation for our partaking of this bleſſed Communion.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>The Doctrine of Christ Crucified, must be believed by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>
               <label>The firſt Inference,</label>
            </p>
            <p>THe celebration of the Lords Supper, being an holy tranſaction between Chriſt and Believers; wherein they have the Communion of his body and blood, then the Doctrine of Chriſt concerning himſelf, what he is, what he hath done, and ſuffered, ſhould be firmly believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as a foundation for our partaking of this bleſſed Communion.</p>
            <p>For if the Doctrine unto which this Sacrament belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and whereupon it dependeth, be doubted, ſuch alſo will our partaking be, not in faith, but doubting; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all concerned, who have a due value for their Souls, are to labour for fixedneſs, in the great Goſpel truths concerning Chriſt, and the way of obtaining Communion with him. I ſhal God willing make this appear, in this <hi>Chapter,</hi> and conclude it with a few words of advice to ſuch Communicants as have moſt need of greater eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the truth.</p>
            <p>Conſider firſt, that mens profeſſing of Goſpel truths is not ſufficient proof, that they believe theſe truths, for many profeſs that which they do not believe, having no firm perſwaſion of theſe truths, in their own minds; but ſtand yet in need of being taught, which be the firſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the oracles of God, even after ſuch profeſſion, and opportunities of knowledge, that they might have been teachers of others, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5, 12.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Nor is want of doubts concerning theſe truths, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient evidence, that they are firmly believed, for the want of doubts doth not always proceed from fixedneſs in Faith, but ſometimes from being unconcerned, whether the Doctrine be true or falſe, not being ſo ſerious, as ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to believe, or doubt,</p>
            <p n="3">3. Nor is it ſufficient, that people have an implicite
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:65303:14"/> Faith in what concerneth their Salvation, becauſe their teachers inſtruct them ſo, and they ſo receive, having nothing againſt it: becauſe men may be eaſily ſhaken out of that ſort of Faith; and therefore we are to receive the Doctrine of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Theſ. 2: 13 not as the word of men, (but as it is in truth) the word of God.</hi> Particularly, firſt if we do not believe there was and is a Chriſt, we cannot converſe with him, for who can ſeek Communion with one of whoſe very being they doubt? Would to God all profeſſed Chriſtians, believed in heart firmly; that there is a Chriſt, as our merciful God, hath given us full evidence for our belief. 2. If we do not believe that he is God and man, God manifeſt in the fleſh, we cannot have Communion with him, as ſuch, and if we have not Communion with him as ſuch, then we have not Communion with the true Chriſt, the Mediator and ſent Saviour of the World. 3. If we do not believe, that he really died, then we can have no Communion of his Body and Blood, Not believing that his Blood was ſhed. 4. If we do not believe that this his Death, and offering himſelf a Sacrifice to the juſtice of God, for theſe who were given him of his Father, was accepted of God, then we cannot lay the burden of our ſins upon and truſt our Souls to that Sacrifice. 5 If we do not believe, that God hath provided a way for our partaking of that Sacrifice, and the benefits thereby purchaſed; then we cannot believe a Participation and Fellowſhip of his Sufferings. 6. And if we know nothing of that appointed way, <hi>viz.</hi> by Faith then we cannot make application of his Death, and ſo ſhal not have the Communion of his Body and Blood. And that the neceſſity of firm believing the Doctrine of Chriſt may appear, Conſider;</p>
            <p>Firſt that we may ſee with grief, how many turn Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates, Athieſts, &amp; Blaſphemers, who were profeſſed Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and appeared to have no doubt of what they profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, for many years, yet by frequent Ap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſtacy mens Souls are ruined, Religion reproached, &amp; Satans kingdom advanced.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It's found alſo, that others of a better ſtamp, who do not precipitate themſelves into ſuch Gulfs of Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, improving the benefit of a good Education, their
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:65303:14"/> practice being in ſome meaſure according to their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: yet in progreſs of years, when they come to be more deeply concerned with their eternal ſtate, and to know on what grounds they can warrantably expect to be no worſe, but better, when this life hath its period; ſearching into theſe grounds, do often find ſuch difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to believe the truths whereof they doubted nothing in their younger years, that their ſouls are caſt into deep diſquiet, and ſometimes are made to bleſs God who hath kept them alive, and under means of knowledge, that they may yet be confirmed in ſome important truths, which nearly concern their very Salvation. And not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that conſcientious Chriſtians, are cautious and ſparing in uttering their Doubts, ſpecially, when they are ſuch as might prove ſtumbling to others; Yet where the benefit of cordial Sympathy is obtained, many are found under diſtreſſing conflicts of this nature, in ſo much that if their gracious God, did not relieve, they could not ſtand long in their profeſſion, but would be noticed to their grief as fainting: Such temptations have not yet left this World, <hi>in vain, I have waſhen my hands in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency,</hi> Pſal. 73. 13.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It's alſo too evidently found, that ſome by reaſon of not being fixed in the great Goſpel truths concerning Chriſt, and Salvation, are retarded in their whole Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian progreſs; for the foundation not being firmly laid, they cannot go on to perfection, this is no charge againſt the foundation which God hath laid; for that is ſtill ſure and unmoveable, 1 <hi>Cor. 3. 11. For other foundation can no man lay, than that is laid, which is Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> For which we are to bleſs God, but it's mens not being fixed upon, and cemented with the true foundation: and whether men will or not, this hath a Secret, ſtrong influence to deaden all their religious practice, when they doubt but all their pains may be in vain at laſt, <hi>and that they have been but beating the air, 1 Cor.</hi> 9. 26.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Some are aſſaulted with violent temptations, tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to doubt of many truths at once, and ſuch as are of great conſequence; and then their weakneſs appeareth, then they ſmart bitterly, for not being eſtabliſhed in the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:65303:15"/> truth, having no ſolid anſwer for repelling of ſuch temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, then they are toſſed to and fro with any wind of Doctrine, yea, many woes are at hand, then they are ready to call good evil, and evil good, and put darkneſs for light, then they are ready to run down the ſtream, and yield all, were it not that God knoweth how to deliver his own out of temptation, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 9.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Known inſtances may be given of ſome who in their day ſhined to the glory of God, and Edification of many, who yet not long before their great change found it their greateſt tryal and difficulty, to be fixed in believing, even as to the object of their Faith: which ſhould be remarked as a warning to weaker perſons to ſpend more of our time and ſeriouſneſs for rooting in the truth, <hi>that we may know whom we have believed,</hi> which was the Apoſtles great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 12.</p>
            <p n="6">6. It's alſo to be obſerved, that eſpecially at Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons Doubts do ariſe in many of the People of God, when they are examining their Faith, and Knowledge, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan always going about to reſiſt good, labouring to obſtruct the beſt works (whereof ſelf-examination is one) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of queſtioning their own weakneſs in knowledge, or ſlowneſs to believe, he tempteth them to doubt of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of their Faith: and if not fixed they are at leaſt ſo diſturbed in their Souls, and caſt down; that they have no confidence for going to the Lords Table: and ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they were not afflicted with ſuch temptations, yet if fundamentals Goſpel-truths be not underſtood, nor a ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious aſſent of the mind yielded to them; then there can be no conſent. An aſſent of the mind may be to the truth without conſent, but we cannot chuſe and conſent to that which the mind doth not believe to be truth. So then you cannot conſent to receive Chriſt at his Table, except ye believe the report and teſtimony that God hath given of him, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 10. Therefore ſpare no pains for knowledge, dig for it as for hid treaſures, account the knowledge of Chriſt excellent knowledge, as others did who knew him better than you, who did look upon other things as but loſs and dung, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 8. Thou haſt none to know like him, nor any knowledge ſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:65303:15"/> as to know him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30. Who is made of God unto us Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs, Sanctification, &amp; Redemption, be not too eaſily ſatisfied with thy knowledge of Chriſt, as many in this age are: Let it be an exerciſe of thy Soul by it ſelf, how to know Chriſt, leſt thy firſt knowledge of him be as of a Judge to give out Sentence, Depart, I know you not: lay this to heart, though thou had not the Lords Table to go to, but if thou wilt go to it ignorant of him, ignorance it ſelf will render thee an unworthy Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant, as I ſear it doth too many in our times, who yet cannot be judicially debarred; what if thy own conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſhould riſe upon thee when thou art going to his Table, and accuſe thee of preſumption, for attempting a Communion with him, to whom thou art a meer ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, not ſo much as believing the record God hath given of his Son? Can ſuch a perſon be accepted of him? La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour then to be acquainted with him in time, <hi>Job</hi> 22. 21. Acquaint thy ſelf with him rendering praiſe to God, that thou has yet a ſeaſon for it; and if thou doſt not affect ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance; but art one who longeſt for the knowledge of the Holy, fearing thou art the very perſon that has not that knowledge, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30. 3. Fearing the danger of thy Soul, were it for nothing elſe, but thy ignorance of Chriſt, fearing alſo to go to the Lords Table, on the ſame ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, then Conſider;</p>
            <p>Firſt, all the true knowledge thou canſt have of Chriſt, and the Doctrine of Salvation by him, is ſupernatural, thou canſt not dig it out of thy ſelf, <hi>None knoweth the Son, but he to whom it's revealed, Matth.</hi> 11. 27. And when <hi>Peter</hi> giveth an account of his knowledge of Chriſt, he is told, <hi>Matth. 16. 17. fleſh and blood hath not revealed this unto thee:</hi> Then thy work is to pray for this knowledge what ever other means thou uſe, thou muſt have it as a free Gift, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 20. He hath given us an underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to know him that is true, it's alſo given to know the myſteries of the Kingdom, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 11. deſpond not, though this day thou art very ignorant of Chriſt, and the myſteries of his Kingdom, it may be thou has too much depended on thy own underſtanding, and not prayed for a given underſtanding; the neglect of this keepeth many
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:65303:16"/> in ignorance, for though we ſometimes grieve, becauſe we are ignorant; yet we are naturally ſo proud, that we had rather have it of our ſelves, than take it as a free gift of God: but take his counſel, who ſaith, <hi>If any man lack wiſdom, let him ask it of God, who giveth liberally,</hi> Jam. 1. 5. Bleſſed Jeſus Chriſt is ſent to open the eyes of the blind, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42. 7. Let him have his work beſeech him to open thy eyes, he will not fail to perform what he came for, if thou wilt ſincerely acknowledge thy blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, remember what he ſaith, <hi>John</hi> 9. 41. if you were blind ye ſhould have no ſin, take it then as a great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to be ſenſible of thy blindneſs, it being the ſureſt way to the beſt light.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Conſider alſo that there are degrees, both of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and faith, though thou come not up to the firſt Worthies, yet thou may'ſt be no unworthy Communicant if Chriſt has ſo manifeſted himſelf unto thee, that thou canſt not live contentedly without him? If what thou haſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered of him hath captivated thy Soul? If thou lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt all thou knoweſt of him? And followeſt on to know more? Though thou ſeeſt not him flying in that glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous brightneſs, that ſome did on the Mount, yet Chriſt will come and meet with thee waiting for him, though at the foot of the Mount, he will come down to thee, when thou canſt not go up to him, and he will be as good as his word, in manifeſting himſelf to all who love him, and keep his words, though he do not manifeſt himſelf in a like manner to all, we muſt be glad to ſee him though thorow a lates's; if ſo be we are ſure it's he, the very Lamb of God, who taketh away the ſin of the world; any ſure knowledge of him, any manner of his manifeſting himſelf, ſhould be highly valued, for where he manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himſelf, there will he come and make an abode, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 23.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It deſerveth a ſpecial remark, that though the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples continued long weak in their Knowledge, confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their ignorance that they knew not the way<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>
               <hi>For the Firſt, The reaſons, why every man ſhould examine before he eat, are theſe,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> It's expreſly Commanded, 1 <hi>Cor. 11. 28. Let a man examine himſelf, and ſo let him eat.</hi> Here is no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of one by another, and therefore we ſhould make none. It's not ſaid, let a poor ignorant man examine himſelf, but men of knowledge need not; it's not ſaid, let a man examine himſelf, the firſt time he receives only, but whenſoever he is to eat, let him examine himſelf. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the neglect of this one Duty, will render a man guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty before God, take care how ye enter the work, if ye go out of the road in the beginning of the way, you ſhal not eaſily know where to fall into it again.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The tranſaction betwixt Chriſt, and partakers of the Lords Supper, is of the greateſt importance for a mans ſoul, for either he ſhal be guilty of the Body and Blood of the Lord, by unworthy receiving, or be bleſſed with the Seal of God for his eternal happineſs; if he truly receive Chriſt: Therefore, previous examination is moſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary.</p>
            <p n="3">3 It's Gods great mercy to our ſouls, that he requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this Duty of examining our ſelves; and therefore ſhould not be lookt upon as a burden, but a mean for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting our ruine; for if after examination, you find your ſelves in the bond of iniquity, and in the broad way to the Pit; It's your mercy to know it, before you feel it: Can you in cold blood, think it adviſeable, that the Pit be your firſt wakening! When the unquenchable flames of Gods wrath are about you, are ye reſolved to underſtand the ſtate of your ſoul no other way? Can this be the way of Wiſdom? Can you approve it? And if you cannot in your own conſcience approve it, but knows it to be a ſinful, and dangerous neglect: Why then will you take a young Hell in your breaſt, to the old? Why do you prepare ſuch a gnawing Worm as this will be? That here is a man, who never had ſo much regard to Heaven,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:65303:18"/> or fear of Hell, as to enquire, which of them he was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, if after examination, ye ſhal find any thing of true Grace, the leaſt grain of that fine Gold tried in the Fire, though covered with much rubbiſh, if any love of Chriſt, and holineſs; though but as a ſmoak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Flax: would not the comfort aboundantly compenſe thy pains, canſt thou deny it? If Chriſt hath given thee grace, is it not worth the looking on, that thou mayeſt at leaſt give him thanks for it? Search therefore diligently, for thou knoweſt not the many bleſſings that may attend a conſcientious Examination, <hi>Pſal. 119. 59. I thought upon my ways, and turned my feet to thy teſtimonies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. We are naturally inclined to flatter our ſelves in our iniquity, <hi>Pſal. 36. 2. He flattereth himſelf in his own eyes.</hi> And if we could, to deceive and flatter God with our lips; And therefore are obliged to make a diligent ſearch, leſt we vainly think we ſtand in need of nothing, when we are wretched and naked, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 17.</p>
            <p>We may think that we live, and have a name that we live, and yet God find us Dead, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 1.</p>
            <p>What woe of woes, what a coſtly deluſion to the poor Soul, if ſtill among the Dead, and at laſt under the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Death, and the poor man has no more to ſay, but I thought I was alive in my Soul, and many others thought ſo of me? I thought that I might be as welcome to the Lords Table, as any Chriſtian was there, I thought my ſelf more upright than many of them, my heart ſaid ſo to me, I many times thought their many Prayers, Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, Groanings, Doubts, and examining themſelves, was either but Hypocriſie, or vain Labour? But now iniquity hath found me out, cannot now have one hour for the Work I deſpiſed, night is come, I cannot now ſee how to work, Night is come without hope of a Morning: Be wiſe then, as to your latter End; for the time is at hand, when men will need no Examinations: you will be all at a point in a few Years, and eternally fixed in your Lot.</p>
            <p n="5">5. If people will not be at pains to examine themſelves before a Communion, they will eaſily neglect it at other
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:65303:18"/> times, and ſo are apt to live out of this Duty while they live; when men become ſo impudent as to face the Lords Table, not obſerving his Direction, and the manner how to approach it, the Direction being perremptory. But let a man examine himſelf: So that albeit there be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctancy to this profitable Duty; yet this ſhould conſtrain to it, as we would not profane the holy things of God: and when people make Conſcience of it, though the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be in its own nature a confirming Ordinance; yet this previous examination hath been ſignally bleſſed of God, being the very time and mean of awakening many out of their ſecure ſleep in their Sins. I know many at this day now exemplary in Holineſs, who can declare that preparation for Communions in their younger years, was the very time their hearts were firſt engaged to Chriſt and his ways.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Some without due examination take up an opinion, that they have no grace, no Title to Chriſt, or his Table; and ſo deprive themſelves of that benefit: This opinion was not the reſult of ſerious Examination, but rather a temptation to obſtruct both their Duty, and Mercy; and this becometh both a Sin, and ſnare to them, a Sin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have not followed Gods Directions in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the very ſtate of their Souls, and a ſna<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by barred up from their ſpiritual good; therefore, this Self examination is moſt neceſſary every way.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Notwithſtanding of the many clear and ponderous Reaſons for this examining before Partaking of the Lords Supper, yet ſome object against it, as,</hi>
            </p>

               </gap>ince ye will not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his? Is your method better than Gods? Your way is either for never Communicating, or never to Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicat aright; for if you will not examine, ye ſhal not

            <p>2. <hi>Object.</hi> I am a Believer, and all Believers will be ſaved, and have a right to the Lords Table, what needeth more ſearching?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> If ye know it, the leſs labour in examining will ſerve, and if it be as you ſay, you are the moſt inexcuſable for this neglect, and do fooliſhly requite the Lord for his bountiful dealing, and gracious obliging you to all chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful obedience; If your faith be ſo clear already, what harm to bring it to the light, ſpecially in a ſeaſon when the Lord requireth the trying of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Do ye know before you try, that your Faith is not Dead? Do ye conſider the direful conſequents of a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take in this? <hi>Is not the tryal of your faith more precious than that of gold, 1 Pet.</hi> 1. 7. Are ye become wiſer than the Apoſtle <hi>James,</hi> who inſiſteth ſo much in the diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of precious juſtifying Faith, that it may be diſcriminate from a deluſive dead Faith? which leaveth its owner dead in his ſins, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 17, 18, 19.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Object.</hi> I acknowledge it a Duty to examine my ſelf, but it's ſuch a Duty as I am not able to manage, I find my ſelf incapable of any advantage by it, for when ever I Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay it, I can come to no concluſion, as to the ſtate of my Soul:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> If you give up with all holy duties that are dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult, then take heed that ye do not next give up with the way to Heaven, for it is a narrow way as Chriſt hath told us; and if you take a Liberty to ſtep aſide al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways when you find it narrow, how do you think to get through it? if you muſt needs have an eaſy way? it is
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:65303:19"/> very eaſy to find it in the Broad way leading to Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, you will have plenty of fellow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> travellours there, who all love it becauſe it is eaſy: Are not all Holy Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties difficult to perform becauſe of the Perverſeneſs of our natures? ſhal we therefore abandon them all? Do ye judge it beſt to give over Prayer, Meditation, Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, Mortification, Plucking out the right Eye, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And all becauſe it is not eaſie to perform them aright: why then ſhould, ye neglect to Examine your ſelves, which is an hand maid and furtherance to ſeriouſneſs in all Duties? but ſtill you ſay it is a Duty ye cannot perform.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> For your help who are willing, but are Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged by your weakneſs to perform it to advantage; firſt Pray that God would determine your heart to ſo clear a Duty, that you may be in Suſpenſe no longer whether to perform it or not, and Pray for aſiſtance to it's profitable management.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Allow for ſo great a work convenient time, and place, that thou mayeſt not be Diverted, nor the Work Hurried over ſuperficially for want of time to attend it, which many are Guilty of who are too Prodigal of time otherways. A <hi>Heathen</hi> could teach us that we ſhould not Complain ſo much of having little time, as that we loſe much; you know how much time is often waſted on verie Trifles, and worſe: Let ſecuring of your Eternal State have at leaſt ſome ſhare, otherways your laſt fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well to time may be very bitter: when Death ſhal ſay not a Moment longer is my Commiſſion, though poſſibly thy Conſcience tell thee ſome time muſt be taken to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine, the Scriptures require it, Miniſters preſs it, and it is the Cuſtom of all who have any ſeeming ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Conſcience, it's mouth muſt be ſtopt leſt it be Clamourous; but then the time allowed is ſo ſcant that nothing is duely Pondered, and ſo it turns to a Name of nothing.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As thou art to allow Competent time, ſo alſo due ſeriouſneſs is neceſſary, that it may be ſuitable to the work in hand, <hi>Examine your ſelves, know you not your own ſelves,</hi> 2 Cor. 13. 5. Remember you have a deceitful
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:65303:20"/> heart to ſearch, the deceitfulneſs of ſin is ſuch as to hide it ſelf in a ſearching time, but you are now to find out Gods Enemies, and your own, you are now to Try Titles whoſe you are, Chriſt's or the Devils, what Title you have to Chriſt's Feaſt of love, do you love or hate Him, hath he cloathed you with a Garment of Salvation, that you may ſit down with Confidence at his Table or not: if theſe things be ſtill triffled over, know that the time is at hand when thou wilt be more ſerious than thou deſireſt; ſerious I ſay, in Hopleſs Terrours: The God of Mercy have pity upon a kind of Infidel Chriſtians in this Age, who do not, and will not Believe what is comming, though Chriſt hath often given Warning, yea, five times together in one place; <hi>Mark</hi> 9. 43, &amp;c. <hi>That the Worm dieth not and the fire is not quenched;</hi> and that for not being ſerious and painful in the Duties of Religion.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>When thou doſt examine thy ſelf,</hi> ſix upon a ſufficient Rule, not thy own imaginations, but the word of God, the Law and Teſtimony. <hi>Iſai. 8. 20. Bring forth the hidden works of darkneſs to this light, for they muſt ſhortly be made manifeſt:</hi> But if thou ſhalt ſay then, I may end my Examining work when they begin, for I have nothing to ſtand before that light, my beſt works are but darkneſs where that Lamp ſhineth, I cannot anſwer for one of a Thouſand of my ways.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Thou haſt no other ſafe Rule, for if thou ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanceſt either thy own Opinion of thy ſelf, or the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of others as a Rule, thou art nothing the wiſer, for theſe may deceive thee and do deceive many, ſome thinking they are rich when they are poor, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 17.</p>
            <p>And ſome have by the Opinion of others, a Name that they live, but Chriſt ſayeth they are dead. <hi>Rev. 3. 1. Whether canſt thou go, but to the word of his lips, who looketh upon things that are equal, from whom thy ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence must come.</hi> Pſal. 17. 2. 4. But <hi>Secondly,</hi> when thou conſidereſt Scripture Precept<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> conſider alſo Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture Condeſcenſion, or Gods gracious Condeſcenſion there revealed, as when the Scripture ſaith, <hi>curſed is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one that continueth not in all things which are written</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:65303:20"/> 
               <hi>in the book of the Law to do them,</hi> Gal. 3. 10. Yet the ſame Scripture of Truth ſaith, <hi>Chriſt was made a curſe for us.</hi> v. 13. ſo John 3. 18. <hi>He that believeth not, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned already.</hi> But Rom. 8. <hi>There's no condemnation to them who are in Christ Jeſus:</hi> Obſerve alſo that God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepteth of ſincerity where obedience to the precept is not perfect <hi>John 17. 6. They have kept thy word,</hi> yet their obedience was evidently Imperfect, Therefore let not this break up thy work, that thou haſt nothing ſuitable to the purity of Gods Law, neither conclude thy ſelf graceleſs, becauſe thou doeſt not that which thou would<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in obedience to God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 19.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Beware of inſufficient marks or evidences either of a gracious or graceleſs State, for thou mayeſt deceive thy ſelf either of the ways: It's not a ſufficient work of Grace, thou takeſt delight ſome times in approaching to God, as <hi>Iſai.</hi> 58. 2. Nor great ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances, <hi>if there be no root.</hi> Matth. 13. 5. <hi>forthwith they ſpring up,</hi> the appearance may be ſuch, as behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers may take notice there is a great change, the ſeed ſpringeth up, then appears a freſh green field, that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared not before, yet no ſound Root; none of the uncorruptible ſeed which ſpringeth up to Life Eternal. Thou mayeſt be again and again aſhamed of thy ſin, and confeſs it as <hi>Saul,</hi> yet no Godly ſorrowing on the account of ſin it ſelf, you may alſo have the out ſide clean and whited beyond others, and yet be but whited ſepulchres, nothing within but Death, what is whiter than a dunghill covered over with ſnow? but when the ſnow is gone the dunghill appears as it was.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, it is not eaſie for a Chriſtian when he Examineth his Souls State, to take the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of grace which hath been attained by the Saints, and makes them the only Evidences of true graces, as <hi>Pauls wiſh, Rom. 9. 3. For I could wiſh that my ſelf were accurſed from Chriſt for my brethren, my kinſmen according to the fleſh.</hi> There is no ground to think that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded as a Mark whereby every Chriſtian muſt Try if he be in a State of Grace, a man may be a ſincere
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:65303:21"/> Chriſtian and not know how to manage ſuch a wiſh. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> underſtood how to abide in Chriſt, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding of this, his extraordinary Zeal for his Countrey-men, <hi>but the meaſure of grace is given according to the gift of Chriſt,</hi> Eph. 4.</p>
            <p>The ſafeſt way is to take Scriptural Marks, ſuch as are ſet down, as evidences of ſanctifying Grace, for it is Dangerous to overlook theſe, ſuch as that, <hi>John 3. 3. Except a man be born again, he cannot enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God.</hi> And 2 Cor. 5. 17. <hi>Therefore if any man be in Chriſt he is a new Creature, old things are past away, behold all things are become new,</hi> and ſuch as that <hi>John 14. 23. If a man love me he will keep my words:</hi> Such as theſe are the Marks we ſhould Try our ſelves by; for the Spirit of God hath given them as Diſcoveries of Grace and our Intereſt in Chriſt, and therefore it is our ſin to neglect them; being a great Mercy that the Lord in a manner Condeſcendeth to anſwer our Queſtions: How ſhall I know if Heaven ſhall be my Habitation? It's anſwered, we muſt firſt be born again, we muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated by the Spirit of God: How ſhall I know if I be in Chriſt? It's anſwered, I <hi>muſt be a new Creature.</hi> How ſhall I know if I have the love of God. It's an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <hi>Prov. 8. 17. I love them that love me,</hi> again, how ſhall I know if I Love him. It's anſwered, I muſt keep his Words, and 1 <hi>John 5. And every one that loveth him, that begat, loveth him alſo that is begotten of him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. When thou art under this Tryal ſeek to have thy Witneſſes aſſiſting and ſpeaking freely. <hi>Rom. 8. 16. The Spirit it ſelf beareth witneſs with our Spirit that we are the children of God;</hi> albeit Grace hath been freely gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thee, yet thou wilt need the help of the Spirit of God to make known the things that are freely given thee, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 12. If the Giver of Grace ſhine not on Grace, it will not appear; the Spirit is the Comforter even on this account, to give the Comfort of his own Grace to to make it evident, for thou canſt not Judge without evidence. 1 <hi>Cor. 2. 10. The Spirit ſearcheth all things, yea the Deep things of God.</hi> Thy ſecond Witneſs is thy own Spirit or Conſcience, <hi>for the Spirit beareth witneſs</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:65303:21"/> 
               <hi>with our Spirits:</hi> Let your Conſcience ſpeak freely all it hath to ſay, as to the very Intentions and Deſigns of thy heart, for what end, and by what Motives thou perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Duties; if thy Conſcience can Charge thee with hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie, let all its Depoſitions have a fair hearing, if it accuſe thee of any retained Idol of heart, or any luſt thou makeſt Proviſion for? if faithful Witneſſes be not heard<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how ſhalt thou Judge of thy State? or if thy Conſcience warrantably Excuſe and Comfort thee, as to thine Integrity that thou canſt humbly appeal to the Searcher of hearts, and thy very Soul content he Search thee, then thou art not to paſs from thine Integrity, <hi>Job 27. 5. I will not remove my integrity from me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. Search not only into your ſins, nor only into your Grace, but search out both: ſome who are under Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage by fear when they Examine themſelves look only into their faults, and often are apt to ſay what need for any further Search, here are ſo many ſins often pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing, I ſee them, I feel their Power, the world alſo may ſee many of them in my Practice, though they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee all; whereupon they are forthwith diſcouraged, they open their eyes upon ſuch Words as theſe, <hi>Pſal. 65. 3. Iniquities prevail againſt me:</hi> and their faint heart not conſidering what follows, <hi>as for our tranſgreſſions, thou ſhalt purge them away;</hi> nor the Intereſt they have in ſuch Comfort that the Lord will purge away their Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, nor that the Grace of God hath made it their ordinary care to <hi>keep themſelves from their iniquities Pſal.</hi> 18. 23. and cannot deny but ſin is their greateſt burden Pſal. 38. 4. And that there is a conſtant warfare againſt it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.</p>
            <p>Some on the other hand ſinfully covering their ſin, conſider only their beſt ſide <hi>Luke 18. 11. Lord I thank thee that I am not as other men, I am more holy than many others,</hi> Iſa. 65. 5. But theſe are found moſt unſavoury before the Lord, as a <hi>ſmoake in his noſe,</hi> they pleaſe themſelves as preferable to all others, they will ſoon ſay <hi>come ſee my zeal</hi> 2 Kings 10 16. but dare not ſay as <hi>Pſal. 139. 24. ſee if there be any wicked way in me: If thou cover thy ſins thou ſhalt not proſper,</hi> Prov. 28. 13.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:65303:22"/> Therefore be ingenuous with God, and thy own Soul ſearch out the worſt, as well as the beſt, and the beſt as well as the worſt; the worſt that thou mayeſt be yet more humbled, and the beſt that thou mayeſt praiſe.</p>
            <p n="8">8 Remember alſo to ſearch into thy former ways, as well as preſent: otherways there may be unpardoned Guilt upon thee for former ſins. <hi>Pſal. 79 8. Remember not against us former ſins.</hi> And Pſal. 25. 7. <hi>Forgive the ſins of my youth:</hi> Try what way thou haſt taken for the pardon of them, leſt as <hi>Lam.</hi> 3 42. thou find <hi>we have tranſgreſſed, thou haſt not pardoned:</hi> Conſider alſo what the Lord did for thee, what he wrought in thee in the days of thy youth, that though thou be not now as lively as then, yet thou muſt be excited to cry unto God as <hi>Job 29. 4. O that it were with me as in the days of my youth, when the Secret of God was upon my tabernacle:</hi> and though thy declinings ſhould be bitter to thee, yet try if it did convincingly ever appear thou waſt the Planting of the Lord, <hi>a tree of righteouſneſs bringing forth fruit unto holineſs:</hi> for If it was ſo, though the Tree ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be cut down, as <hi>Job 14. 7 There is hope of a tree if it be cut down, that it will ſprout again,</hi> and verſ. 9. <hi>through the ſcent of water it will bud and bring forth boughs like a plant;</hi> gather what thou canſt ſafely of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that thou mayeſt yet hope to ſing as in the days of thy Youth, <hi>for trees of righteouſneſs never utterly decay both root and branch.</hi>

            <p n="9">9.

            <pb n="25" facs="tcp:65303:22"/>
            <p>The <hi>fourth</hi> thing to be conſidered is, what we are to Try and Examine, and the things that I conceive to be the moſt neceſſary are, 1. Our knowledge. 2. Our Faith. 3. Our Love. 4. Our Repentance, and 5. Our O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.</p>
            <p>As to our Knowledge. 1. It's neceſſary we have ſome meaſure of Knowledge of the Lord Himſelf. 2. His Covenant. 3. Of the Sacrament it ſelf, particularly how to Diſcern the Lords Body.</p>
            <p>Ye are firſt to Try your Knowledge of God in Chriſt, for though it be a ſmall Portion of him we can know, yet we muſt know or periſh. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1. 8. Chriſt is coming to render Vengeance to them who know not God. This Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God we muſt have by Jeſus Chriſt, for the Light of the Knowledge of the Glory of God is in the Face of Jeſus Chriſt 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 6. We cannot tranſact with him in this Ordinance if we be Ignorant of him. 1 <hi>John 1. 6. For if we ſay that we have fellowſhip with him, and walk in darkneſs we lie.</hi> Therefore ſome competency of Saving Knowledge we muſt have, leſt we be found Children of Darkneſs, yet 2. In Examining this think not to find a Knowledge unto Perfection, for that which is Perfect is to come, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 10. And when that is come, all that is in that Infinite Divine Majeſtie, can never be be known by us or finite Creatures. We are apt vainly, and ſome times Preſumptouſly, to deſire ſuch a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge as is Gods peculiar Prerogative perfectly to know himſelf, and too often more curious to know what we cannot know, than what we ſhould and may know: how ſilencing to all fleſh ſhould be. <hi>Exod. 3. 14. I AM</hi> and though all Creatures be incapable of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive knowledge of that Glorious Immenſe being; yet 3. Great ſhal be our mercy to apprehend aright of him, if your conceptions of him be ſuitable to the Revelations he hath given of himſelf in his VVord, content thy ſelf with theſe, leſt thou wander in thy I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginations and loſe thy ſelf in Aſpiring further. 4. Do not conclude thou knoweſt nothing of him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou knoweſt not as thou wouldeſt, or knoweſt not as thou a Believer ſhalt hereafter. 5. Yet try if thou
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:65303:23"/> art ſure that though weakly, yet it is certainly the Lord himſelf, thou knoweſt this is a greater attainment and mercy then many think, to have the Soul delivered from fear of deluſion in it's apprehenſions of God. Theſe words <hi>Jer.</hi> 24. 7. are of great Conſideration, <hi>I will give them a heart to know me that I am the Lord.</hi> Theſe people had long profeſſed the Knowledge of God and yet need to know that he is the Lord. 6. To be ſure of thy knowledge, try what Impreſſions have the Divine Attributes made on thy Soul, what effects attend thy knowledge. Pſa. 9. 10. <hi>They that know thy name will put their truſt in thee.</hi> Try alſo if thy practice can prove thy knowledge. Jer. 22. 15. 16. <hi>Thy father did judgment and juſtice, he judged the cauſe of the poor, then it was well with him, was not this to know me ſaith the Lord v.</hi> 7. In a ſpecial manner try if Chriſt hath manifeſted himſelf to thee, if thereby thou has been enabled to Behold him, and in Beholding transformed into the ſame Image. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 18. Be particular with thy Conſcience, to have an account wherein that Bleſſed Image doth appear.</p>
            <p>2. VVe muſt try what knowledge we have of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, Becauſe,</p>
            <p>Firſt, This Ordinance of the Lords Supper is one of it's Seals; for here we have the New Teſtament in his Blood, and this blood is the Blood of the Covenant. Heb. 13. 20. <hi>The blood of the everlaſting Covenant,</hi> therefore the Seal ſhal be profained, if there be no knowledge of that gracious Tranſaction and Covenant unto which it is a Seal. 2. VVe are obliged actually to renew our Covenant with the Lord when we partake of this Ordinance, for we are to embrace Chriſt according to the Terms of his Covenant: Receiving of Chriſt, and joyning our ſelves to the Lord is the very Subſtance of the VVork, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be performed if we be Ignorant of the Covenant, for who can take hold or joyn in a Covenant where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he is utterly Ignorant? and the man who taketh not hold of the Covenant, cannot have a right to the Seal, try then particularly.</p>
            <p>Firſt, If ye know the chief Articles of the Covenant, if ye know the Difference betwixt doing, as the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:65303:23"/> of the Covenant of VVorks; and believing as the Condition of the Covenant of Grace: try if you believe this great Goſpel truth in your heart, <hi>that whoſoever believeth ſhall not periſh</hi>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ohn 3. 16. 2. And that the Covenant of Grace requireth perfection, though ſincerity be accepted, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 48. 3. And that all ſincere be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving hath gracious Fruits and VVorks attending it, <hi>for we are created in Chriſt Jeſus unto good works</hi> Eph. 2. 10. 4. Do ye know him who is <hi>ſurety of this better testament</hi> Heb. 7. 22. In whom all the Promiſes are, yea, and Amen.

            <p>5. Do ye know that all your Salvation and all that ye ſhould deſire is in this Covenant. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 5. That it's <hi>Ordered in all things for your good and ſure,</hi> hath the Lord ſhowen you his Covenant, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25. 14. Do ye in heart believe it to be ſure? 6. VVere ye ever taught of God how to take hold of this Covenant, and how to Subſcribe your ſelves the Lords, Iſa. 44. 5. <hi>One ſhall ſay I am the Lords, and another ſhall ſubſcribe with his hand unto the Lord;</hi> If ye know nothing of it, ye can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not perform it, and if not performed the Seal is not yours, for ye have not Subſcribed to the Deed. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member Chriſtian thou haſt no other Charter for thy part of Heaven but this Covenant of Grace, and if thou art a Chriſtian indeed, it will be to the as a Fountain of Joys, <hi>that he hath made with thee an everlaſting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> thou wilt never think thy ſelf ſafe till thou know thou art Savingly in it; and therefore it will be the great concern of thy Soul how to Joyn thy ſelf to the Lord, eſpecially before thou partake of it's Seal: bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed is that hour wherein a man may ſay, now I ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed my ſelf the Lords, I have given my ſelf to him, and he hath received me graciouſly, what has thou to do from thy Birth to thy Grave, like this which can make thee ſing in the face of Death.</p>
            <p>3. Try thy Knowledge of the Sacrament it ſelf, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if thou canſt Spiritually and believingly Diſcern the Lords Body, for if thou Diſcerneſt no more than
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:65303:24"/> Bread and VVine, thou wilt Receive no more; and if thou Receiveſt no more, thou haſt not Received the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Chriſts Inſtitution, thou haſt but a ſhadow for the Subſtance; beſides the Guilt of profaning that Holy Ordinance: The words of the Holy Ghoſt are carefully to be remarked. 1 Cor. 11. 29. <hi>he eateth and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Damnation to himſelf, not diſcerning the Lords Body.</hi> This Diſcerning of his Body is a Diſcerning Spiritually Chriſt himſelf as Crucified; and if this one thing be wanting, the Communicant will ſurely Eat and Drink unworthily: Therefore put ſuch Queſtions as theſe to thy ſelf: Firſt I am perſwaded that the Son of God, did take unto him our nature, and in due time did ſhed his Blood, for the Remiſſion of the ſins of many? 2. That this our Bleſſed Saviour did Inſtitute this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the Lords Supper to be Celebrated in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of him. 3. That the Bread and VVine there preſented and Bleſſed, doth Repreſent his Body and Blood. 4. That Chriſt who Offered himſelf to his Father, doth in this Ordinance Offer himſelf to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by Believers. 5. That in Offering himſelf to be Received by them, he Offereth unto them alſo the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits purchaſed by his Death. 6. That every partaker muſt ſo Diſcern him by Faith. 7. And every Partaker is Obliged by Faith to Receive himſelf with all his Benefits, when he Receiveth that Bread, which Chriſt Requireth to take and eat, and that no perſon ſhould preſume to eat of that Bread or drink of that Cup, but with a full purpoſe of heart thankfully to Receive him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf? ſeek to be eſtabliſhed in theſe before thou go to the Lords Table, that thou mayeſt partake in Faith, and not by eating and Doubting, or Eating and Ignorant what thou art about, many Souls are Guilty before God, for taking ſo little pains to prevent their being Guilty of the Body and Blood of the Lord, and ſome not of the very worſt, obſtruct their own Comfort by indiſtinct Communicating: there being no action under the heavens that Requireth more fixed, ripe, and diſtinct apprehenſions, than partaking at the Lords Table.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Our Faith muſt be Examined before we go to
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:65303:24"/> the Lords Table. Conſider firſt the Reaſons why this muſt be done. And 2. How to find out Saving Faith. The Reaſons. 1. Chriſt himſelf is to be Received at his Table, and this Receiving of him is Believing, as is plain by John 1. 12. <hi>But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the ſons of God, even to them that believe on his Name.</hi> Therefore Chriſt cannot be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived without Faith, and if he be not Received, the Sacrament is profaned: The Communicant ſhould be a believing Believer, having Faith not onlie in Habit, but in Act.</p>
            <p>3. Our Faith muſt be Examined, becauſe we are VVarned that there are manie ſorts of Faith, and yet but one kind of Faith Is Saving whereby the man is Juſtified: we Read of a Believing which Devils have <hi>James</hi> 2. 19. Some wicked men alſo are ſaid to Believe, yet remaining in the bond of Iniquitie, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 13. VVe have an account alſo that ſome Believed for a while <hi>Luke</hi> 8. 13. It's Lamentable that men ſtand not in awe of ſuch Scriptures, and ſo few moved with fear, leaſt their Faith be no better, we Read alſo of ſome mens Faith raiſed ſo high as thereby to work Miracles, and yet their laſt Sentence <hi>Depart from me, Matth.</hi> 7. 21, 22. It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears theſe men did miſtake true Saving faith, thinking ſuch as they had, would cary them to Heaven; for they make it a plea for their Admiſſions, <hi>did we not caſt out Devils in thy Name;</hi> doubtleſs this made them Chriſtians of great Fame in the VVorld: but how eaſie is it even for men of great Gifts to miſtake Faith, and go to Death without a Diſcovery of that Myſterie. VVe are warned alſo of a dead faith <hi>James</hi> 2. 17. Such a faith as found men, and leaveth them dead in their ſins. It cannot therefore be ſafe after ſuch warnings, for any man to Conclude, that becauſe in the general he belleveth, therefore he ſhal be Saved, and hath a Right to the Lords Supper, except the nature of his faith be inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and made out to be ſuch as thereby he is united to Chriſt, and ſo ſhal be Juſtified.</p>
            <p>4. This Danger of miſtaking Faith being ſo great, it's our Mercy that there is a particular Command to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:65303:25"/> Examine our Faith as we would be Secured, we are not Reprobates, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 5. So that if this be ſtill neglected, we not only endanger our Souls by Deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but ſhal be found ſinfully diſobedient to a merciful Command.</p>
            <p>5. That which is ſaid Heb. 11. 6. <hi>That without faith it's impoſſible to pleaſe God,</hi> ſhould of it's ſelf engage us to Examine our Faith; what Regard can we have to God, and be contentedly in that State, wherein it's im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to pleaſe him, or be ignorant whether in that State or not? can ye look up to God and think it not worth the while to enquire whether ye be pleaſing or diſpleaſing to him? Dare ye ſit down at his Table not knowing, but it may be ſaid of you in particular, it's impoſſible for this man to be pleaſing to me? and no wonder he cannot be accepted as not being in Chriſt, there's no acceptation but in the Beloved, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 6.</p>
            <p>Theſe few Reaſons without adding mo, may convince, that it highly concerneth thee to be at the utmoſt pains in trying of thy Faith; Conſider alſo that all thy pains ſhal be richly payed Home, if by ſearching thou ſhalt find that God hath beſtowed upon thee Precious Faith, 2 <hi>Pet. 1. 1. The Faith of Gods Elect,</hi> Tit. 1. 1. That <hi>Faith</hi> whereby a ſinner is <hi>justified and hath peace with God,</hi> Rom. 5. 1. That Faith whereby thou art Sanctified, <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 18. That Faith the end whereof ſhal be the Salvation of thy Soul, 1 <hi>Pet. 1. 9. Receiving the end of your faith even the Salvation of your Souls.</hi> What pains ſhould be valued where this is the Reſult. How great may be thy Joy in his Salvation, when thou canſt ſay, <hi>The beloved is mine, and I am his,</hi> Cant. 2. 16. Chriſt is mine, the Pledges of his Love are mine, his Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is mine, his Food and Table is mine, <hi>He hath clothed me with the garments of Salvation,</hi> Iſa. 61. 10. I ſhal not be rejected for want of a Wedding Garment, <hi>Shall be not with Chriſt freely give us all things,</hi> Rom. 8. 32.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> But what way ſhal I take to Examine my Faith? Firſt try if you can obſerve the direct Actings of Faith, that you may ſay now Lord I believe, though before it be well out of your lips, ye muſt add Lord help my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:65303:25"/> 
               <hi>Mark</hi> 9. 24. Acceptable Believing is of ſo great Importance, that ſerious ſouls are ſolicitous ſo to Believe, as that they might immediately Reflect upon it, and finding it believing indeed; Bleſſed Jeſus Chriſt would needs have it out of his Diſciples own mouths that they did Believe, <hi>John 16. 30. By this we believe,</hi> They do not ſay we have Belleved, but in the very preſent time we Believe. And in the next <hi>verſe,</hi> Chriſt ſaith <hi>Do ye now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,</hi> for this Cauſe it were good eſpecially for you who doubt of your Faith, to ſet your ſelves for actual pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Believing before ye go to the Lords Table; ſome people are apt to weary of long Debates in their mind, whether they have Believed or not; and tempted to give it over, who by the Bleſſing of God upon this mean are Relieved of their Fears, and cleared of their Doubts, Addreſſing themſelves to the Lord with all the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and Seriouſneſs they can attain, and in the Senſe of their ſin and need of a Saviour, ſet themſelves to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and Embrace Chriſt as their Redeemer and Lord. This Mean hath been ſo Countenanced of God, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it's ſerious Performance, ſome hath gone to the Lords Table with deſire, Chearfulneſs, and Peace though Doubting before.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Oject,</hi> But I cannot Believe when I pleaſe, nor is it ſo light a matter to go off hand and Believe, and ſo have done.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Ye cannot Believe too ſoon; if you Believe indeed. 2. This is an Opportune Seaſon for it, when ye are called to Partake of an Ordinance which you cannot neglect without ſin, nor Partake without Believing.</p>
            <p>3 Ye are peremptorly Commanded to Believe, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it's Duty to endeavour it; and it's ſuch a Duty as ſhould not be Deferred: That ye are Commanded Conſider, <hi>John</hi> 14. 1. 1 John 3. 23. <hi>And this is his Comandment that we ſhould believe on the Name of his Son Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And that it's a Duty not to be Delayed, ſee John 3. 36. <hi>He that believeth not, the wrath of God abideth on him.</hi> If you ſtill reply, I cannot Believe though it be a Duty: I will Anſwer that no more can you
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:65303:26"/> perform any Religious Duty aright, will ye therefore reſolve to perform no Religious Duty? will ye not Pray, becauſe ye cannot Pray aright? will ye never praiſe, becauſe ye cannot do it aright? ſee what thy verie Reaſon can <hi>Anſwer</hi> to this plain Argument; what ever God Commandeth we are obliged to endeavour Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence unto it, but God Commandeth us to Believe, therefore we are Obliged to endeavour Obedience to this Command of Believing. And though it be granted that we cannot Believe when we will, yet we are to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, and put out the Withered Hand, hoping we may take it in Whole: if the Lord ſhal ſay <hi>ariſe from the dead,</hi> as <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 14. Should we Diſpute and Proudly Quarrel in ſtead of Obeying? cannot the Lord of Life give Life with the Word of Command as to Dead <hi>Lazarus,</hi> mind John 11. 25. <hi>He that believeth in me, though he were dead yet ſhall he live.</hi> But if ye cannot find the Truth of your Faith by this manner of Trial; yet ye are not ſo to leave it, for what quiet can a man have in his Soul, not knowing but he is ſtill un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Wrath of God? as all Unbelievers are, and not knowing what hour that VVrath may Surpriſe him, with it's intollerable weight and Eternity. Therefore other Means muſt be eſſayed to Search it out by it's Fruits, for Luke 6. 44. <hi>A tree is known by his fruits,</hi> and the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> ſaith <hi>He will ſhew his faith by his works:</hi> it's a great mercy that there is any way to have it ſecured.</p>
            <p>Conſider theſe two ways, wherein by the Bleſſing of God, the ſincerity of your Faith may be Diſcovered, as firſt, by trying your ordinary Dependance on God, and 2. By ſearching into the Gracious Fruits of Faith, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially that by Faith the heart is purified, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 9.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, enquire at your own Conſcience, what Courſe is ordinarly taken for Light and Direction, when ye are in Darkneſs or Doubts; do ye ſtill lean to your own Underſtanding, or on Chriſt as made of God VViſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom unto Believers, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30. 2 VVhen ye do Pray for wiſdom and Light, is it that you may walk according to that Light or Direction? Deal ye Ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly with God? not ſeeking Counſel of God, with a
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:65303:26"/> Reſerve, if it be to your own Humour, but Reſolved to walk in his Light whitherſoever it lead you, has thy Soul fixed on the Lord as thy Guide, then Remember what is ſaid; Pſal. 73. 24. <hi>Thou ſhalt guide me with thy Counſel, and afterward recelve me to glory,</hi> for Glory will follow, to the Followers of this Guide.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Try alſo what way thou taketh for thy Guilt: whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doſt thou go for eaſe to thy Conſcience when it accuſeth thee? (as it certainly will if not ſeard) is it to the Blood of Chriſt? or doſt thou make a cover to thy Sin of thy Duties, thy Tears, thy Mourning, thy Amending of ſome evil Practices, and thy not being as ſome other men? if this be thy way, thou art yet a Stranger to Goſpel Faith: but if thou believeſt in thine heart, that the Blood of Chriſt cleanſeth from all ſin, and thou will not diſhonour that perfect Sacrifice, by thinking it inſufficient for thy ſin, and therefore leans thy Soul with all it's Guilt upon him, <hi>who made his ſoul an offering for ſin,</hi> Iſai. 53. 10. Thy care is to be found in him not having thine own Righteouſneſs, but that which is by the Faith of the Son of God, thou muſt have a Jeſus to Save thee from thy ſins, thou muſt flee to him as thy Refuge, then Conſider what is ſaid, Heb. 6. 18. <hi>That we might have a ſtrong conſolation, who have fled for a refuge:</hi> our merciful Redeemer ſaith not to the poor ſinner, thou hadſt never come to me, but becauſe thou could make no other ſhift, thou has made me thy laſt choice; therefore be gone. No no but when the poor ſinner cometh only by a Conſent of neceſſity, yet he will in no ways caſt him out, though he could find no other Refuge, yet when he cometh he ſhal have ſtrong Conſolation; thou findeſt Bleſſed Jeſus like none but himſelf, for this not the manner of men.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Search thy way, as to the ſubduing of thy Sin: if thou ſuffereſt ſin peaceably to prevail as its willing ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, or is its prevailing bitter, making thee often com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain to God againſt thy ſelf, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 65. 3, Art thou not often crying to him, that no ſin may have dominion over thee? That he would cleanſe thee from ſecret faults,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:65303:27"/> and keep thee back from ſinning, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. 12, 13. Art thou not ſearching alſo upon what ground thou mayeſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the mortifying of any ſin; For if thou art ſincere with God, and pained with Sin, thou will be as earneſt to know upon what grounds thou may expect the ſubduing of ſin, as the pardon of it. Therefore it will not ſuffice thee to have it to ſay, thou has prayed for a clean heart, but to know what encouragement God hath given to hope for it, this will make thee ſearch the Promiſes for cleanſing and ſanctifying of thy Soul, and what intereſt thou haſt in theſe Promiſes, this will make thee careful for an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in Chriſt Crucified, that by him thy luſts may be crucified, and that thou ſerve ſin no more, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 6. And though it be one of the greateſt trials of thy Faith, to believe the mortification of ſome rooted ſins that eaſily beſet thee, yet dare thou not diſtruſt the Promiſe of God, <hi>Ezek. 36. 25. From all your filthineſs, and from all your</hi> I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <hi>dols will</hi> I <hi>cleanſe you:</hi> Though thou has been ſtriving ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years againſt ſome particulur ſins, without the deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſucceſs, yet thy regard to the Promiſe continueth, thou dependeſt ſtill upon it, as <hi>Mic. 7. 19. He will ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due our iniquities:</hi> This is the Faith of the Saints, who now inherit the Promiſes.</p>
            <p n="4">4. When thou has Duties to perform, far above thy ſtrength: try what is then thy ways? Doſt thou neglect them, becauſe they are difficult, or doſt thou go to thy work in the ſtrength of the Lord God? If thou goeſt to work in his ſtrength, then thou art acting Faith: Art thou not ſtrongeſt, when weakeſt in thy own opinion; and upon this experience, that out of weakneſs thou art made ſtrong, and that God never faileth thee, thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolveſt to refuſe no duty he requireth of thee? for thy <hi>Ebenezer</hi> is ſet up hitherto hath God helped: this is direct living by Faith; and if Believers were more exact in remarking, how often God doth countenance their eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſays to believe, when they are weakeſt in their own eyes the comfort of their Faith would not be ſo rare; how gratefully is it to be remembred, that when there is ſharp ſenſe of guilt, and fear of being deſerted, becauſe of guilt, yet engaging in work that God calleth unto, ſome
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:65303:27"/> can hardly inſtance a time when they lean to promiſed ſtrength, but God appeareth the glory of their ſtrength: Whoſo obſerveth theſe things, are in the way to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the loving kindneſs of the Lord, and ſo obtain the comfort of their Faith.</p>
            <p n="5">5. If thou canſt not yet take comfort to thy ſelf, that this precious Faith is thine: Search yet further, for it's worth the pains of many days or years, if it be found at laſt: Try then if thou canſt find it in the Furnace of affliction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where ſometimes it ſhineth more brightly, than in any eaſie lot.</p>
            <p>In the day of thy Calamity whether goeſt thou for help, to the arm of Fleſh, or to the arm of <hi>Jehovah?</hi> Where goeſt thou firſt, doſt thou no ſooner come to trouble, but thou lookeſt up to meet with God as ſoon as the trouble? There is much to be diſcovered of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance of a Soul, by the way it firſt taketh in Affliction; for what is habitually truſted, is commonly firſt reſorted unto; When godly <hi>Job</hi> heareth the ſurpriſing tidings of the Death of his dear Children, and other loſſes; imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly he looketh to God and Worſhippeth, <hi>Job</hi> 1. 20. So when <hi>David</hi> was diſtreſſed by the <hi>Amalakites,</hi> taking his Relations, and all away Captives, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30. 1. The firſt thing he doth, is to encourage himſelf in the Lord, <hi>verſe</hi> 6. But the firſt thing we hear the poor Men ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, who were not ſo acquainted with dependance on God, was the Stoning of <hi>David.</hi> Next, when thy tryals are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verwhelming, ſo that thou art ready to ſink; Try if thou believeſt that there is a Rock able to bear thee, and the heavieſt of thy Burdens; and that God hath not left his people ſo deſtitute, as that periſhing muſt needs be the reſult of theſe overwhelmings: But as it is, <hi>Pſal. 61. 2. When my heart is overwhelmed, lead me to the rock that is higher than</hi> I: So thou betakeſt thy ſelf to God, as thy Rock; and withal commits the leading of thy ſoul unto this Rock, to him who is thy Rock, here is abounding Faith, not only truſting the Lord as the Rock of Ages, but the leading of thy ſoul to himſelf, thou commits the very management of thy Soul into his hands, if thou canſt claim this as thy way, then thou has the precious Faith thou art ſeeking after.</p>
            <pb n="36" facs="tcp:65303:28"/>
            <p>Try alſo the unſeignedneſs of thy Faith, by other un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeigned fruits: If thou has true Faith toward God, it will carry up thy heart to him; thou will live upon Chriſt, and obtain ſome real victory over this World, it ſhal not captivate thy ſoul, as it doth the ſouls of Men who have their portion in this life, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 4. It will raiſe thee to the affectionat Meditations of thy better <hi>Countrey,</hi> and there thy deſires will be captivated, until thy ſelf be placed with them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 16.

And though this evidence of Faith appeareth dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult, becauſe of the many impurities of heart remaining in Believers: Yet the Words of God muſt be regarded, and this purifying of the heart, muſt, and will be found, where juſtifying precious Faith is; for Believers even in this life obtain ſome meaſure of true purity, as appeareth by <hi>Matth. 5. 8. Bleſsed are the pure in heart, for they ſhall ſee God.</hi> For here Chriſt declareth ſome are pure in heart, before they come to ſee God, as they ſhal ſee him here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, ſo, <hi>Joh. 15. 3. Now are ye clean, or pure,</hi> as the word is commonly rendered; Believers being in a juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied ſtate, they obtain in this life ſome real purity of heart, notwithſtanding of their Imperfections; and it becometh a ſnare, or woe to ſouls that ſtudy no purity, becauſe of no intire perfection in this life, and theſe have the true beginnings of holy purity, who follow that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, and direction, 2 <hi>Cor. 7. 1.

            <pb n="37" facs="tcp:65303:28"/>
            <p>Search diligently for this purifying of the heart, as thou wouldeſt not be deceived of thy faith &amp; hope, for accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to 1 <hi>Joh 3. 3. Every man that hath this hope in him, purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himſelf, even as he is pure;</hi> think not of accepting thy ſelf, where the words of God are, every man examine your ſelves, Particularly in theſe 4 things;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> If thou findeſt an active Principle in thy Soul ſtanding in oppoſition to ſin; if ſin be hated, ſo as thou can ſay of it, it's the evil I hate, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 15. See that this hatred be not pretended, and Sin in the mean time cheriſhed; for it's not only a ſure ſtep toward, but alſo a great length in the purity of holineſs, to be a hater of Sin.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And to ſecure the truth of this hatred, try if there be an ordinary warfare againſt Sin: For if it be hated, there will be oppoſition made to it, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 23. Thy ſins will feel thy grace to have ſome power; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt compareth the mortifying of ſin to the cutting off the right hand, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And where there is nothing of this, it's vain to pretend hatred.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Try if thou loveſt the Law, which requireth this purity: for to love that very Law which re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

O how love</hi> I <hi>thy law.</hi> There is the greater neceſſity of ſearching into this, becauſe it's given us as the character of a godly man, to delight in the law of the Lord, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1. 2.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Try what ſucceſs attendeth your endeavours againſt ſin: if by dependance on the ſpirit of Chriſt, which mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifieth the deeds of the body, it may be ſaid of you, as 1 <hi>Pet. 1. 22. Seing ye have purified your ſouls in obeying the truth</hi>

A manifeſted Chriſt is the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and beauty of that work, even when he manifeſteth himſelf, as crucified, bleeding to death; he is then moſt lovely and beautiful to the Believer, he then ſheweth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf dying in pure love; and what manifeſtation of him ſhould be more engaging, and overcoming; but no eyes can thus profitably behold him, except he manifeſt and ſhew himſelf, which the lovers of Chriſt may expect, and therefore our love to him ſhould be examined.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This holy Communion is a banquet of love; and therein it might well be ſaid he giveth his loves, giving himſelf and the pledges of his love, <hi>Cant.</hi> 7. 12.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Chriſt himſelf condeſcendeth to give us help how to reſolve this queſtion in propoſing to us a ſure evidence of love, <hi>John 14. 23. If a man love me, he will keep my words.</hi> And though this mark appear difficult, becauſe of our many failings in keeping of his words; yet it will be dangerous to overlook it, and may prove a contempt of the mercy that is in ſuch a diſcovery, and a neglect of ſo gracious a bond to obedience, that as we would teſtifie our love to Chriſt, we muſt keep his words.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Hereby Chriſt alſo ſheweth that a ſtudy of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and pleaſing him will natively flow from love, if we love, we cannot but endeavour to pleaſe the Party beloved, his commands will not be grieveous, 1 <hi>John 5. 3.

            <p n="3">3. And when this is become your habitual affectionate eare to pleaſe him, though there be fuilings; yet Chriſt can diſcern the ſincerity of your love, and ſay, <hi>you have loved me, Joh.</hi> 16. 27. He can diſcern a willing ſpirit, when the fleſh is weak; though Chriſt had his Diſciples often to reprove, yet knowing he had their hearts, and that their ordinary care was to obey him: He as their good advocat, declareth to his Father that they had kept his Word, <hi>Joh. 17. 6. And they have kept thy word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> If ye be lovers of Chriſt, ye will deſire his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:65303:30"/>

            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> True love to Chriſt is earneſt for his love, and cannot be quieted without it: there is a wonderful bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in this Grace, they aſpire to no leſs than to know that Chriſts deſire is toward them, <hi>Cant.</hi> 7. 10. Then they know they are ſafe, then they know he will not be long from them, the deſire of their ſoul being toward him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26. 8. And his deſire toward them, his favour and love is better than life to them: And therefore they cry as, <hi>Pſal. 106. 4. Remember me O Lord with the favour that thou beareſt to thy people:</hi> It's the love that thou haſt to thy choſen that is my happineſs, whatever other mercies I get, yet they will all leave me miſerable if I have not that favour, which is peculiar to thy choſen, Lord give me that favour which will at length make me glory with thine inheritance, Lord do to me, <hi>as thou uſeſt to do to thoſe who love thy Name, Pſal.</hi> 119. 132. Try what ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs and wreſtlings you ever had for his love, or if common mercies, or common Gifts of the Spirit, be all which you ſeek after.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> If thou be a ſincere lover of Chriſt, thou wilt love his honour, yea, the very place where his honour dwelleth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 26. 8. Thou wilt deſire his praiſe may be glorious, <hi>Pſal. 66. 2.

I will praiſe thee O Lord my God with all my heart, &amp; I will glorifie thy Name for ever more.</hi> Put ſuch queſtions as theſe to thy own ſoul. Is it on my heart how to glorifie him? Do I cry to God in ſecret for help to glorifie him? Is it my rejoycing, when he giveth help to do it? Have I fear, that vain glory be more ſtudied, than his glory? Am I as much grieved for diſhonour to him, as diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to my wretched ſelf? Hath the grace of God ſo far
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:65303:31"/> prevailed, that no applauſe of men is ſatisfying, except I have ſome teſtimony in my conſcience, that I really de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned the glory of God: That bleſſed Word of Chriſts, ſhould humble us, and make us aſhamed of that predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant ſin of pride in the World, <hi>John 8. 50.

The want of this love to Gods glory, and indulged love to vain glory, makes many a poor man loſe all his labours in Religion, and ther's no remedy without uprightneſs of love to God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly, Every one that loveth him that begat, loveth him alſo that is begotten of him, 1 John</hi> 5. 1. If thou loveſt Chriſt, thou will love his Image, and where his renewed Image ſhineth moſt, there thou will love moſt: This is ſo much regarded, that it's improved for the certainty of mens be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paſſed from Death to Life, <hi>becauſe they love the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, 1 John</hi> 3. 14. Try then who are the excellent in the earth in thy account, try if thou loveſt godly perſons though mean in the World, or if thou art ſuch as can va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue no man for his godlineſs, except he be rich in the World; Try if thou canſt love a godly man, though he have no great opinion of thee, it may be thou deſerveſt no great? opinion, and ſhould not love him the worſe for that: Try thy ſelf the more exactly in this point of thy love to the people of God, becauſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God is greatly diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured in this age for the want of it. Beware of patcht up counter feit agreements, and love before Communions. But as thou art to labour for Communion with Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſo labour to the utmoſt of thy power, for a cordial Communion of Saints, that you may Feaſt together here in love and hope, to be together in a better place, and be not ſaying, I forgive ſuch a Chriſtian, but I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire never to ſee him, I deſire never to ſpeak with him: this will not be found forgiving from the heart as Chriſt requireth, <hi>Matth. 18. 35. Let your love be without diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation, Rom.</hi> 12. 9. Not in Word only, but in Deed, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting the good name of one another, <hi>See that ye love one another with a pure heart ſervently, 1 Pet.</hi> 1. 22. Theſe
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:65303:31"/> are the Words of God, but Ah how little regarded, and I fear ſhal not be much regarded, while we continue fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling from our firſt love to Chriſt, love to him, and his followers muſt revive together.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>We ſhould alſo examine our Repentance,</hi> becauſe;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Chriſt hath enjoyned it with a certification, that except we repent, we ſhal periſh, <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 3. How ſpeechleſs will it render the impenitent periſhing ſinner, when the Books are opened, and this found, that this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured ſinner was forwarned of this periſhing, but ſhut his ears, and would not hearken.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This repentance is that part of Religion, which we are moſt averſe either to act, or try; and therefore the greater need to oblige our ſelves to ſearch if we have it: For to hear of Faith, and love, and Love goeth more eaſily down, the very naming of them is ſweet to ſuch as know little of them; but cannot with patience hear of conviction, mourning, or departing from iniquity; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny alſo continue to enſnare their own ſouls with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit that they believe ſo well, that they need not trouble themſelves with repentance; but they ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark Chriſts requiring of both, <hi>Mark</hi> 1: 15. Repent and believe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Others obſerving repentance to be peremptorly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, Conclude that ſome repentance they muſt have, but are ſatisfied with a ſhadow of it, and are ſo ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial, that any extorted flaſh of ſorrowing, any change any returning, though not to the moſt High ſatisfieth them. We find, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 7. 16. That ſome return, but not to the moſt High. They think they have returned ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently. And therefore need no more ſaying as <hi>Mal. 3. 7. Wherein ſhall we return?</hi> The Lord ſeeth that they are yet to turn to him, as in the ſame <hi>ver. return unto me,</hi> ſaith the Lord, but they think otherwiſe, this ſhould make us afraid, leſt God do not iudge of our Repentance as we do, and therefore to examine it in time; It's eaſie for people to think themſelves ſufficiently qualified for a Communion, or for Heaven it ſelf, but the woe will be that it was only themſelves thought ſo, when they find God their judge of another mind,</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:65303:32"/>4. There is the more need to examine our Repentance in this age, wherein the broken in ſpirit, and contrite in heart, are as ſigns and wonders; as if all the broken in heart before us had been in an error, and troubled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in vain, or as if God never regarded any ſuch Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exerciſe, and wounding of Spirit, though he hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly declared, <hi>Iſa. 66. 2. But to this man will I look e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to him that is poor, and of a contrite ſpirit, and trembleth at my word.</hi> Then it's neceſſary as men would have God to look favourably upon them, as ye would have a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable reviving, look at this Table, to try if ever you were wounded in heart for your ſin: See to it leſt the ſearcher of hearts have it to ſay, here is a man, that to this day was never humbled, <hi>Jer.</hi> 44. 10. Never pierced at the heart; never at what ſhal I do to be ſaved, never ſo wounded, but he could eaſily cure himſelf, no uſe for that mercy, <hi>Pſal. 147. 3. He healeth the broken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds.</hi> You will needs go to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, but it's not for any great buſineſs you have to do there, you have no burden of ſin to take off; as find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it too heavy for your ſelves, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 38. 4.</p>
            <p n="5">5. There is the greater need to ſearch particularly into the ſincerity of our Repentance, before we approach the Lords Table; becauſe ſome ſerious Chriſtians may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive themſelves of that benefit, fearing their Repentance is not ſound, and that becauſe they had never ſuch a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of grief as others, never ſo deeply wounded for ſin as they think they ſhould, or as they have perceived by others who refuſed to be comforted, were long in bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of fear, and ready to be ſwallowed up with grief and terrour.</p>
            <p>To clear this alittle, Conſider, firſt, That trouble or terrour of mind of it ſelf, cannot prove any gracious good in a ſoul: A <hi>Judas</hi> hath terror of mind, but no grace, ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour is ſometimes a Judgement from God, as <hi>Lev. 26. 16: I will appoint over you terrour;</hi> and <hi>Deut. 28. 20. The Lord ſhal ſend upon thee vexation,</hi> And ſome wicked per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are conſumed with terrours, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. 19. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it's not ſafe to deſire ſuch terrour of mind as ſome have been under; for it was their plague.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:65303:32"/>2. Men may have a temporary ſorrowing and grie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, which ſin hath occaſioned, and yet their ſorrowing is not for their ſin, nor any ſanctifying grace in their mourning. A <hi>Saul</hi> may lift up his voice and weep, and confeſs o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers more Righteous than himſelf, and yet ſtill go on in his ſin, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 16, 17. Some may make a great noiſe of their repentance, as <hi>he lift up his voice and wept.</hi> And yet but a worldly ſorrow that <hi>David</hi> was like to have the Kingdom is his greateſt grief.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Some are ſurpriſed with a ſudden fear of Wrath, which they cannot ſhake off; but are as captives, ſo far from any true and humbling ſenſe of ſin; that all their trouble is for being troubled, and cannot help it. They are in chains and fetters not knowing for what, for it ſeiſed them without any apprehenſion, or ſenſe of their ſin: This doth ſometimes make a great alteration and commotion while it continueth, ſo that they tremble un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, as <hi>Felix, Acts</hi> 24: 25. The poor man knew not what was come on him, he is frighted but getteth no good of it; and therefore deſires <hi>Paul</hi> to be gone: I have ſeen ſeverals after the ſame manner frighted with a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den fear of Judgement, and for any thing appeared, their Religion never went a greater length; yet their trouble in the time was great, and made a great noiſe, but when the fright was over, their Religion was alſo over. It is not ſafe then to ſet up ſuch as paterns for your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, though the degree of their anguiſh might be greater than yours.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Though the Law be our School-maſter to bring us unto Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 24. Whereby we muſt have the knowledge of our ſin, be convinced, be humbled: Yet we ſhal not find that every one who cometh to Chriſt is, or muſt be a like meaſure humbled, all are not in a like depth, before their heads be brought above water, all have not the pangs of the new Birth alike painful, all are not ſtruck down to the ground, and made blind before they be comforted, as <hi>Paul,</hi> We find not the degree of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny mans grief for ſin, ſet up as a Standard, whereby all others muſt be meaſured; but we find the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a worldly, and a godly ſorrowing much regarded,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:65303:33"/> 2 Cor. 7. 10. <hi>For godly ſorrow worketh repentance to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not to be repented of, but the ſorrow of the world worketh death.</hi> Therefore we ſhal be wiſer to ſearch out the nature of our grief, than its degrees only, If it be a godly ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing on the account of ſin, and its ſinfulneſs, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking a holy and gracious God, This we find made a ground of comfort to the people of God, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. That they ſorrowed after a godly ſort, and reformation attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their ſorrow.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It's neceſſary alſo, that we take care leſt our preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing for ſuch a meaſure of grief, be not by the ſecret de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulneſs of our hearts, deſigned as a Sacrifice for our ſin, Idolizing it too much, as if thereby ſin might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piated.</p>
            <p n="6">6. It would be alſo conſidered, that poor frail men may be ſwallowed up with overmuch ſorrow; ſo that ſome perſons ſeek after they know not what, even ſuch a meaſure of ſorrow as might be their own ruine, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2: 7, You ought rather to comfort ſuch a man, <hi>leſt perhaps he be ſwallowed up with overmuch ſorrow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. Where ſorrowing for ſin is truly godly ſorrowing; yet one Chriſtian may have a higher degree, than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther who is alſo ſincere; a man may have true Faith, true Love, true Repentance; and yet another exceed him in all theſe: for both the grace, and its meaſure are the gift of Chriſt, <hi>Eph. 4. 7. But unto every one of us is given grace according to the meaſure of the gift of Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. Yet becauſe the moſt common danger is a defect in this godly ſorrowing, and no ſincere humbling found, with many profeſſed Chriſtians, no ſuch grief or hatred of ſin, as can bear the name of ſound Repentance, and effectual turning to God: Therefore as it is a moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary grace, we ſhould ſeek to grow in it, as we would have God to lift us up, we muſt be humbled, <hi>Jam. 4: 10. And bleſsed are they that mourn, for they ſhall be comforted,</hi> And that you may be in ſome meaſure helped to diſcern the ſoundneſs of your Repentance, Search thy own ſoul for theſe things.</p>

This makes it appear, that ſin is hated in the ſoul, when thou doſt ſearch for it as an enemy to be caſt out, when a ſoul is ſo ſtraight with God, that help is deſired to find out his enemies, <hi>Pſal. 139: 23.

            <p>6. Doſt thou take care not to be aſhamed of thy Lords words? but Confeſſeſt him before men: then take comfort from what Chriſt ſaith, Mat. 10. 32. <hi>Whoſoever therefore ſhall confeſs me before men, him will I confeſs alſo before my Father which is in Heaven;</hi> and mind what followeth in the next, verſe <hi>But whoſoever ſhall deny me before men, him will I alſo deny:</hi> and though we have not often the occaſion of ſuch publick confeſſions, as many Bleſſed witneſſes had before us, yet while we converſe with men on Earth, we ſhal ſtill be found either confeſſing Chriſt, his words, and true godlineſs; or aſhamed and fainting: great may be their Comfort who a vow Holineſs in all companies. This is the more to be adverted, becauſe if ſome Chriſtians be permitted to keep their chambers, or much retired from Converſe with men, then they obtain ſome meaſure of comfortable exactneſs in their Practice; but no ſooner engadged in Company, but ſome fainting appears, ſhrinking from their former ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſs, and failing of the Duties required in all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, ſinfully forgeting God; whereby they often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn with loſs to their Souls, and a condemning Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.

               <p>Senſe of ſin neceſſary before Partaking.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>
               <label>The third Inference,</label>
            </p>
            <p>THis Bleſſed Ordinance of Chriſt being the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of his Body and Blood: Then Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicants are to approach it with a humble ſenſe of their ſin, as needing the Vertue of that Precious Blood.</p>
            <p>And that this is neceſſary, Conſider.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> That if ye have not the Senſe of your ſin, you cannot duely regard a Crucified Chriſt; and ſo may miſtake the whole work, deſpiſing his Death as of no great uſe for you, and ſo cannot and will not apply his Blood for purging away of Sin and Guilt: for thou art not ſenſible of Guilt: This of it ſelf were there nothing elſe, will make thee eat and drink Unworthily; undervaluing that Life-giving Death, for the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants work is humbly and thankfully to receive a Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified Chriſt Repreſented in that Ordinance, as knowing they periſh without him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If there be no humbling Senſe of ſin, thou ſhalt Partake as an hypocrite: pretending before God and men, that thou comeſt to Embrace Chriſt as the onely propitiation for thy ſins; and yet there's no ſuch thing on thy heart: Thou doeſt not Judge thy ſelf ſo Guilty, or that ever thou provocked God to ſuch wrath, but that leſs might have ſerved; Thou felt no ſuch a Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of thy ſin, but ſuch as thy ſelf could bear with great eaſe, thou wondereſt there ſhould be ſuch a ſtirr in the World about ſin, thou never committed any ſin but thou hadſt a Covering of thy own to caſt over it. Thou couldeſt at any time after thy greateſt abominations with the whoriſh Woman, Prov. 30. 20. <hi>Wipe thy mouth and ſay I have done no wickedneſs:</hi> If thus thou comeſt to the Lords Table thou wilt but receive Bread and Wine, finding need of no more.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:65303:37" rendition="simple:additions"/>3. If thy ſin do nothing ſmart and wound thee, thou wants the very beſt Qualification of a Communicant, which is hungring after the Bread of Life, <hi>For he ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth the longing ſoul,</hi> Pſal. 107. 9. The Lord hath his Eye upon ſuch, more than all others. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſai. 66. 2. <hi>But to this man will I look, even to him that is poor and of a contrite ſpirit;</hi> he findeth out ſuch when others are paſſed by, ſuch as are ſo ſenſible of their Guilt that they wonder that he ſhould look upon them, any other way but to Conſume them, ſuch as are aſhamed to look up to him becauſe of their Iniquities, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40. 12. And yet are Longing for a Favourable Look, They cannot look up, and yet cannot but look up, neceſſity conſtraineth them to hang upon him for Mercy, knowing they periſh without him; ſuch as theſe will be Graciouſly Viſited and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 57. 15. He will revive the ſpirit of the Humble and revive the heart of the Contrite ones. But thou a Stranger to theſe Contritions of heart, will be a Stranger alſo to theſe Revivings, and no wonder, for thou feeleſt no need of them, and therefore Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That it's the way of God, firſt to wound, and then to Heal, Deut. 32. 39. I <hi>wound, and</hi> I <hi>heal:</hi> If thou didſt never know any Wounding of heart for ſin, what Healing canſt thou either expect or value; for no wounding, and no healing, no caſting down, and no raiſing up, no ſickneſs, and no Phyſician, For the whole need not the Phyſician but the Sick; Thou haſt no uſe for his coming with Healing under his Wings, Thou has nothing to Heal, he may ſpare his Viſit until thou has more need of him, and keep his Medicines for others. Thus thou mayeſt ſit down at the Lords Table with the Beſt, but Chriſt and thy Soul have no Merciful meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. When the poor and needy are drawing out of Chriſts fulneſs, getting their Diſeaſes Healed, and their Souls Reſtored, Thou art ſent away Empty, neither art thou Diſappointed for thou ſought after no more; Thou canſt not complain of Chriſt, for he Refuſed thee nothing thou ſought, Thou art like theſe, <hi>Rev 3 17. I have need of nothing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:65303:37"/>5. Conſider alſo, that of all the meetings between Chriſt and poor ſinners on this Earth, this is the moſt Endearing and Comfortable, when Senſe of deep Guilt and deep Mercy meet together: ſome times the poor ſinner is ready to ſink under the weight of Guilt, it's a Burden they cannot bear, the Fear of Gods Wrath and Separation from him being intollerable; The Soul chuſing rather if poſſible to be Reduced to nothing; and ſome times ready to Cry out, O happy no Beings, being compared with me, they ſhal have no Anguiſh, but my Anguiſh I can neither bear nor eſcape, no Mountains can cover me from my Judge, no Death will extinguiſh my Pain, but if I die in my ſins my pain ſhal never Die, Death will flee from me: when thus the the poor ſinner is Bruiſed and can ſtand no longer, how Gracious is that Meſſage, as Job 33. 24 <hi>Deliver him from going down to the pit, I have found a ranſom.</hi> And Ezek. 16. 6. I <hi>ſaid unto thee when thou waſt in thy blood, Live.</hi> I die for thee that thou mayeſt not die. I am come that thou mayeſt have Life; then the Bleſſing of theſe who were ready to periſh are poured out upon the Ranſomer. Then as Mic. 7. 18 <hi>Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity.</hi> The deeper thy Senſe of Guilt be, being joyn'd with ſome hope of Mercy, thou art in the ſurer way for the rich Conſolations of God, they that Sowe in Tears ſhal reap in Joy, the Lord hath appointed the Garment of Praiſe after the ſpirit of Heavineſs, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 61. 3.</p>
            <p n="6">6 And though thou has no fear of Wrath; having ground to hope that thou art Reconciled to God by the Blood of Chriſt: Yet come humbly becauſe thy ſins are againſt ſuch Streams of Mercy runing upon thee, and paſſing by others; thou knoweſt that thou haſt never lived Suitable to the Greatneſs of thy Mercy, never fully payed thy Vows, never Glorified God in body and ſpirit, as it became one not his own but Bought with a Price, much is required of thee, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe much is given thee; let the Senſe of this go deeper in thy heart; for if hope of Pardon make thy ſin eaſie; thou has cauſe to ſuſpect both thy ſelf and thy
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:65303:38"/> hope: There are no Convictions ſhould be more hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling than fooliſh requiting of the Lord, and no Grief more grieving than grieving of his Spirit, who minded our griefs and knew our Souls in adverſities: Thou will not want Matter of humbling to take with thee to the Lords Table and need of Renewed Application of that Precious Blood, If thou open thine eyes to ſee thy way, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 23.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Come humbly in the Senſe of thy ſin; that thou mayeſt value the leaſt of Mercy and the very Crumbs that fall from his Table, and if ſuch a full Cup of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation be not poured out to thee as to others, or as at other times to thy ſelf, yet to Juſtifie God in thy heart not thinking thou haſt hard meaſure, not wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing if he hide his face from thee, but rather wondring if it ſhine upon thee, conſidering thy Provocations: This true Senſe of thy unworthineſs will make thee think, O that I may have a Cup of Salvation when I go to his Table, whether it be a Cup of preſent Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or not.</p>
            <p>And that thou may'ſt approach with ſome humbling ſenſe of thy ſin. Conſider, that there muſt be ſome more deadly poiſon in ſin, than we do apprehend, when no leſs doth expiate the guilt, than that Blood, which is called the Blood of God, that no other Sacrifice nor Offering could avail. Study O Chriſtian to know more of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merit of ſin, the greatneſs of the Juſtice of God, that would accept of no other Atonement, and the greatneſs of thy deliverance; if thou art now a Believer, that the weight of wrath is not come upon thee; And think with thy ſelf, thou by thy ſins pierced him, thou brought bleſſed Jeſus to ſweat theſe drops of Blood, thou preſſed on him with the weight of thy ſins, until he cryeth out, <hi>My GOD, my GOD, why haſt thou forſaken me.</hi> Canſt thou want a humbling ſenſe of ſin, and think this was for thee? Canſt thou yet mind it, and not mourn? What hateful hearts have we, that are not more pierced with the pierc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt, and a wonder, if many of us find an intereſt in that Death, wherewith we are ſo little concerned.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:65303:38"/>2. Be Particular and Impartial, in ſearching out the Aggravations of thy Sin, from thy Youth up; and when convictions ariſe in thy Conſcience, choke them not, but intertain them as a Mercy, until they be ripened for gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious humbling? Thou may'ſt ſoon lay aſide thy convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but not ſo ſoon take them up again, it may be God gave thee the mercy of many Convictions, but thy love to ſin has maſtered them all, that now thy Conſcience lets thee ſin with eaſe, being ſeared, and thy heart hardned; and no wonder for many wakenings of Conſcience that ſtill end in ſecurity, makes our hearts as the Iron, many heats, and many cools, makes the Iron harder.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But when none of thy Meditations, or Convictions can ſoften thy heart, but thou can behold thy ſin, and not grieve, and often confeſs it, yet canſt not mourn, never get thy heart poured out to God, except ſome weight of Affliction preſs thee, and then thou wilt pour out a pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er when the Lord is chaſtening thee, and when thy afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is over, the pouring out of thy heart is at an end: I ſay, when nothing prevaileth with thy obdured heart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet bleſs God, that there is a promiſed ſpirit of mourning, <hi>Zech. 12. 10. They ſhall look upon me whom they have pierc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and they ſhal mourn.</hi> Cry to God for this help, that thou may'ſt go to this bleſſed Ordinance, as is expreſſed, <hi>Jer. 50. 4. going and weeping,</hi> and verſe 5. <hi>joyn thy ſelf to the Lord in a perpetual Covenant.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>IF that the worthy Receiver at the Lords Table obtain the Communion of his Body, and Blood: then Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants are obliged to underſtand what that is which is called Communion with Chriſt, before they Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, leſt they be found ignorant of it when they Partake: Conſider then that true Communion with Chriſt being the happineſs and honour of all who obtain it, meriteth
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:65303:39"/> the greateſt ſeriouſneſs, to know how ſinful Mortals par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of it: And though it be wonderful, yet the exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing riches of free Grace hath made it ſure: for Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers have the priviledge of entering into the holieſt by the blood of Jeſus, and ſo obtain a more gracious nearneſs to God, than thoſe who remain only in the outer Court: and that this may appear for the incouragement of thoſe who ſtill retain a value for it, but fears that this fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is reſerved wholly for a better life; I ſhal by the help of God, ſhew firſt that Believers in this life partake a peculiar and intimate fellowſhip with Chriſt. <hi>Secondly</hi> It's preparatory Antecedents, whereby they are brought unto it And <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Wherein it conſiſteth, and the way how it's enjoyed, ſo far as God giveth to underſtand it, I can promiſe the Reader no more.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>Firſt,</hi> This bleſſed Communion with the Lord, is not only Commanded both in the Old and New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Micah 6. 8 walk humbly with thy God.

We will come unto him, and make our abode with him; So that Believers may expect ſucceſs to their Prayers, and endeav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The near Union that is between Chriſt and Believers, doth undeniably prove this Communion, he being the Head, and Believers the Body, ſupplied in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very part by the Head, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 16. He the Vine, and we the Branches, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 5. The very deſign and ſcope of theſe ſimilitudes is, to hold forth Chriſts continued Communications, and the Believers Participation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The experience of the godly who have publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it doth alſo prove its certainty, 1 <hi>John 1. 3.

               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Believers remarking his drawing near, and withdrawings from their ſouls, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 1. He hath come into his Garden, and <hi>Cant. 5. 6. he had withdrawn him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:65303:39"/> Lam. 3. 57. In the day when I cryed, thou dreweſt near,</hi> and Pſal. 13. 1. <hi>Why hideſt thou thy face,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> This Communion with Chriſt, is of ſuch neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, that a Believer can do nothing without it, and on this account, Chriſt requireth his followers to abide in him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 5. So that they do but diſcover their ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, and eſtrangement from God, who think there is no nearer Communion with him neceſſary, than the external adminiſtration of Ordinances, by the Word and Sacraments; for many do enjoy theſe externally, and do only draw near to God with their lips, and their hearts far from him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29. 13. The godly man findeth it good to draw near to him, and ſo near as to find him the ſtrenght of his heart, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. 26. That is intimate Communion indeed, to have the Lord the ſtrength of a mans heart, Oh that our merciful God would give the underſtanding of this to many, who have never thought on ſo near a help as this; for ſuch may well go in the ſtrength of the Lord God to any work he requireth, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf being the ſtrength of their heart; What if our heart be found as a dried withered branch of a Vine that is fit for no work, yet that witheredneſs ſhal not be known, when he cometh to be the ſtrength of our heart.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For the ſecond thing propoſed, how the People of God are brought into this Communion with Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Fountain of it is the eternal and free love of God, whereby ſo many as pleaſed the Father are given to the Son, by that eternal, myſterious and merciful tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action between the Father and him, and by him to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed and prepared for the everlaſting enjoyment of God, compare <hi>Joh. 17. 6. Thine they were, and thou gav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſt them me,</hi> with <hi>Joh. 6: 37. All that the Father giveth me, ſhall come unto me.</hi> He will effectually draw them into his Communion, they ſhall come unto me, and ſo muſt meet together. 2. According to this glorious tranſaction in the Covenant of Redemption, the eternal Son of God, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to have his delight with the Sons of men, before the foundation of the World, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 31. Fore-known unto God, are all his Works from the Beginning, things, future being as preſent to his intuition; So that the Son of God hath always taken pleaſure in theſe of the ſons
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:65303:40"/> of men, who were given him of his Father. 3. Purſuant to the ſame tranſaction, and in order to its accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; It pleaſed the Son of God often to appear before his Incarnation in the ſimilitude of man on earth, and converſe with Men as a fruit of his eternal delight in them, and a prelude of his Incarnation, as one haſting this gracious nearneſs, and more conſpicuous Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with him, <hi>Gen. 32. 24. Jacob was left alone, and there wrestled a man with him, Dan.</hi> 3. 24. He appeareth as a man keeping company with the three godly men in the Furnace, and his form appeared alſo as the Son of God, this fourth glorious man made the place deſigned for tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the three, a place of joy, and a very Paradiſe. 4. In order to the ſame partaking of Communion with God, a Covenant of Grace is publiſhed, which is a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage Covenant, <hi>Iſa. 54. 5. Thy maker is thine huſband,</hi> 2 Cor. 11. 2. I <hi>have eſpouſed you to one husband</hi> by vertue of this honourable relation, Believers may plead for his dwelling with them in this holy Communion. 5. In due time the Son of God was Incarnate, taking unto him our nature, that his Fellowſhip might be the more agreeable to our nature, and we come the more familiarly unto him; and thereby to have the more feeling Sympathy with us, <hi>Heb. 2. 14. For aſmuch then as the children were partakers of fleſh and blood, he alſo himſelf likewiſe took part of the ſame, that through death he might deſtroy him that had the power of death.</hi> and ver. 18. <hi>For in that he himſelf hath ſuffered, being tempted, he is able to ſuccour them that are tempted.</hi> Having taken our nature, he continued for ſome time in the World, and converſed with men eſpecially his own, <hi>Joh. 1. 15. He dwelt among us, and we beheld his glory.</hi> And though this people were not always to have his bodily preſence; Yet at that time he did manifeſt ſo much of his power, meekneſs patience, and mercy; that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he did facilitate the knowledge of ſpiritual Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with him, ſome alſo beheld his glory, and had Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Communion with him, while he was in the World. 6. After he had given a gracious taſte of his Fellowſhip, and given inſtructions for its continuance in a ſpiritual manner, in his own appointed time he purchaſed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:65303:40"/> for all that were given him, laying down his life for them, that being reconciled by his Blood, they might be capable of Fellowſhip, being agreed they might walk together, and 1. <hi>Pet. 3. 18. The juſt ſuffered for the unjuſt, that he might bring us to God.</hi> and <hi>Eph: 2. 13: But now in Christ Jeſus, ye who ſometime were far off, are made nigh by the blood of Christ,</hi> So that his ſuffering were to bring his People into this gracious Fellowſhip with God. 7, In order to their actual Fellowſhip with him, he qualifieth them by pouring out of his Spirit, <hi>Ezek. 36. 26. A new heart will</hi> I <hi>give, and a new ſpirit will I put within you.</hi> Whereby they are made meet for the Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters uſe, as a ſanctified People, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2: 21. Without this, there could be no Communion with a holy God, our perverſe natures being rather inclined to hide our ſelves from him, and ſay, Let the Almighty depart from us; but by the renewing of the Holy Ghoſt, they have the ſpirit of Love, whereby the deſire of their ſoul is toward him, his Fellowſhip comes to be their deliberate and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectable choice; So great a change doth the ſpirit of Grace make, <hi>Eph. 2. 22. In whom alſo you are builded together for an habitation of God through the ſpirit.</hi> And by the ſame ſpirit, they obtain the grace of Faith, which is a fruit of the Spirit, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 22. And by this Faith they receive Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, <hi>John</hi> 1. 12. Then we are united to Chriſt by receiving him, and being united to him, he dwelleth in our hearts by Faith, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 17. So that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Chriſt doth infallibly follow upon our union with him, for where he is received, there he dwelleth; no wonder Faith be called precious, ſeing thereby we are brought into this ineſtimable benefit, of having Chriſt the hope of glory dwelling in us, not for any intrinſick worth of our Faith, but according to <hi>Rom. 4. 16. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is of faith that it might be by grace,</hi> free grace began it, free grace carrieth it on, free grace will perfect this Communion, in placeing the Believer there, whence he ſhal go no more out, but be for ever with the Lord, and where it began, there muſt its eternal center be, <hi>Even the praiſe of the glory of his grace,</hi> Eph. 1. 6.</p>
            <p>The <hi>3d</hi> thing is to know more particularly, wherein
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:65303:41"/> this Communion with Chriſt doth conſiſt, and how we partake it, which we are to conſider theſe two ways,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> As Believers are receivers only of Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from Chriſt. 2. As they are made active them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in entertaining this Communion.</p>
            <p>For the Firſt, Believers are ſaid to be partakers of Chriſt himſelf, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 14. They have him, he is theirs a great intereſt, a great gift! Shal he not with him free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly give us all things. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 32. A large Inheritance broader than the Earth, larger than the utmoſt Heaven of Heavens, the light and glory of the beſt and pureſt Heaven, what thought of the Worm man can apprehend aright of this Wonder? That, that one may be ſaid to be ours, <hi>Cant. 2. 16. He is mine, and I am his.</hi> Believers par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of Chriſt, as to both his natures, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4. We are made partakers of the Divine Nature, they partake of his love and favour, and thereby admitted to a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous acceſs, <hi>Eph: 3: 12. In whom we have boldneſs, and acceſs.</hi> 2. They have the benefit of his Divine Attributes, Omnipotency, Wiſdom, Holineſs, Mercy, &amp;c. <hi>Ezek. 36: 9. For behold I am for you.</hi> The Believer alſo hath the benefit of his humane Nature, <hi>Heb. 4. 15. For we have not an High-prieſt which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, but was in all points tempted like as we are, and yet without ſin.</hi> This ſweetneth and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth our Communion, as the words of the following <hi>ver.</hi> ſheweth, <hi>Let us therefore come with boldneſs to the throne of grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Believers have Communion with Chriſt in his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices: as to his Prieſtly Office, he is our Paſſeover Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed for us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 7. The Believer is bleſſed for ever, by that one Offering. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 4. As to this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical Office, Chriſt is the great Prophet, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18. 18. Whom we are to hear, <hi>Who is made of God unto us wiſdom, 1 Cor.</hi> 1. 30. Thus we have that benefit of an underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to know him that is true, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 20. Here alſo our debt by partaking of Chriſt is deep; for we were blind, and had remained ſo for ever, if he did not open the eyes of the blind. So alſo as he is King in <hi>Zion, Pſal:</hi> 2. 6. And King of Saints, <hi>Rev.</hi> 15. 3. Thus he maketh a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:65303:41"/> conqueſt of us unto himſelf, making us a willing peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by his power, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110. 3. There is no more to do when he pleaſeth, but <hi>ariſe and follow me,</hi> and it's done, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9. 9. Thus he ruleth in Believers, Subduing their iniquities. Thus his people are commanded to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce greatly, becauſe of their King, <hi>Zech:</hi> 9: 9. Here alſo Believers ſhare deep in Communion with Chriſt, bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them through the throng of enemies within &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſafely to Heaven, and making themſelves Kings, and Prieſts unto their God, <hi>Rev:</hi> 5. 9.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Our Bleſſed ſurety, and Redeemer, not only died to bring us to God, but to ſecure this Communion, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth the Believer ſtill along with him, for in his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection he hath them together with him, they are quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together with Chriſt, <hi>Eph:</hi> 2: 5. And raiſed up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. That very act of power that raiſed him from the Dead, raiſeth all his: They were dead in Sins, and while ſuch, they were incapable of Communion with God, but by vertue of Chriſts Reſurrection, they are quickened, and qualified, for converſe with the Living God, So that there alſo the allowance is large, and the Communion near, being raiſed up together with Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In his aſcenſion, he doth not leave them as to Spiritual Communion with them, for when he is aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and the World ſeeth him not, yet Believers by Faith ſee him: <hi>Joh. 14. 19. The World ſeeth me no more, but ye ſee me:</hi> and whereſoever he go <hi>becauſe he liveth, they ſhall live alſo;</hi> then their Communion with him ſtill holdeth, the influences of Life continuing upon Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, they live with him, and ſee him when the World cannot ſee him.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And when he is ſet down at the right hand of God; yet there they are not forgot, <hi>for he appeareth in the preſence of God for them,</hi> Heb. 9. 24. And continueth his Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, for perfecting of this bleſſed Communion: he ever liveth to make Interceſſion, the Believer hath Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him as his Advocat, to plead his cauſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Father; 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 1. He hath not turned off his people on Earth, when he is exalted himſelf; O
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:65303:42"/> happy Intereſt in Chriſts love, that nothing can ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, no increated, inconceiveable pleaſure and glory in the high and lofty Place, cauſing any forgetfulneſs of the poor weary Travellers, longing to be with him, but what ever they have to do there, he is ready, and will appear their Advocat and do their work: ſo that when they have finiſhed their courſe, they ſhall have no more to do but enter into peace, all being friends where they go, and all this by him.</p>
            <p n="6">6. And when he cometh again, accompanied with his mighty Angels, to judge the World, yet Believers muſt ſtill be near him; <hi>therefore they are ſet on his right hand, Matth.</hi> 25. 33. But this is not all, <hi>for they ſhall be ſet on Thrones alſo, judging the twelve tribes of Iſrael.</hi> Matth. 19. 28. They cordially conſenting to his judging, and what Sentence he ſhall paſs: neither is this all, but more is yet coming, with what humility Reverence, Sobriety, and Admiration ſhould we think on theſe words following? <hi>Joh. 17. 22. And the glory which thou gaveſt me, I have given them: that they may be one, even as we are one,</hi> and <hi>Rev. 3. 21. To him that overcometh, will I grant toſit with me in my Throne:</hi> He only who ſpake theſe words, can give us to underſtand them for our good and comfort, without erring by proud, vain, and dangerous imaginations; but let us obſerve theſe two things, 1. That the glory of the Believer is ſtill to be near Chriſt. 2. That he who before time had his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light with the ſons of men, continueth his love, untill he ſet them down in heavenly places together with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: ſo that this bleſſed Communion was eternally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned, and ſhall be eternally enjoyed.</p>
            <p>And now in time, is the ſeaſon to have it ſecured, before we enter into that eternity; what pains can be ſufficient for a pledg of being for ever with the Lord? Oh, that ſo few of men appointed to an eternity, mind where it ſhall be, whither with Chriſt, or with Devils: a little more time will diſcover it, and time is precious on this very account, that we are as yet called into fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with the Son of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and may have hope of ſuch a beginning of it here, <hi>as nothing preſent, or to come</hi>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:65303:42"/> ſhall ſeparat. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 9.</p>
            <p>Bleſſed Jeſus Chriſt hath opened a door for it by a new and living way, which he hath conſecrated for us through the Vail, that is to ſay, <hi>his fleſh Heb.</hi> 10. 10.</p>
            <p>He hath opened his door, and ſtandeth knocking: knocking at our doors for this fellowſhip. He hath a deſire to uſe his Followers as Friends, and to admit them unto a comfortable Communion with him. <hi>Joh. 15. 15. Henceforth I call you not ſervants; for the ſervant know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not what his lord doth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father, I have made known unto you.</hi> Which is not ſo to be underſtood, as if they were no more to ſerve him; for when they are at their beſt, <hi>his ſervants ſhall ſerve him, and ſee his face;</hi> Rev. 22. 3. and well may it ſerve the beſt of them, at their beſt. But the matter is, that Believers are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to more than the ordinary priviledge of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, which is to have great Myſteries and Secrets communicated to them; for ſo our Lord explaineth it, <hi>the ſervant knoweth not what his Lord doth, but I have made known to you,</hi> &amp;c. He ſometimes openeth the very ſecret counſel of God to them; <hi>the Father himſelf loveth you.</hi> Joh. 16. 27. and Pſal. 25. 14. <hi>The ſecret of the Lord is with them that fear him.</hi> This leadeth me to the ſecond thing propoſed; That Believers are made active in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining this communion, wherein Chriſt and the Believer do intimatly converſe together as Friends; tho' with a due diſtance on their part: this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion is the very life of a Believer. Gal. 2. 20. <hi>I live; yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me:</hi> this only ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the Believer fruitful. Joh 16. 4. <hi>Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of it ſelf, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it abide in the vine:</hi> for the better underſtanding of this actual fellowſhip with Chriſt, I ſhall premit theſe few things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That tho' the Infinite and Immenſe Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, be not far from every one of us; <hi>For in him we live, and move, and have our being,</hi> Act. 17. 28. Yet as to his gracious preſence, ſome are ſaid to be far off, <hi>Pſ. 73. 27. They that are far from thee ſhall periſh:</hi> and we are
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:65303:43"/> required to draw nigh to him, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4. 8. and theſe who were far off, are made nigh. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2 13. So that theſe Expreſſions of being near unto, or far from God, are Scriptural: and therefore ſhould not be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, or ſtumbled at by any, on the account that God is every where preſent.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is no ſpecial and gracious communion with Chriſt, where there is not firſt union with him by faith: ſome wonder they have not that communion with Chriſt that they read and hear of, but conſider not the reaſon that they are not agreed, and ſo cannot walk to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. How confidently, and I fear ignorantly, do ſome ſpeak of communion with God, as if it were due to them, who as yet are uncapable of it, until they be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to God, there being no entering into the holieſt but by the blood of Jeſus.</p>
            <p n="3">3. After a poor ſinner is united to Chriſt by faith, he is never altogether deprived of ſome communion with him, Joh. 14. 19. <hi>Becauſe I live, ye ſhall live alſo,</hi> and Chriſt dieth no more; and <hi>verſ. 23. We will make our a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode with him.</hi> And <hi>he that believeth ſhall never die.</hi> Joh. 11. 26.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Yet every Believer is not admitted to the ſame degree of nearneſs, as to the manifeſtations of Gods gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious preſence, every believer getteth not his face to ſhine with that glory as <hi>Moſes, Exod.</hi> 34. 29. Yet he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſteth himſelf to all who firmly love him. <hi>Joh</hi> 14. 23.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The beſt of Believers obtain not in this life, that degree of nearneſs which ſometimes they deſire; when <hi>Moſes</hi> got his face to ſhine, yet was he covered with the hand of God, and did ſee but his back-parts, after he had beſeeched God to ſhew him his glory. <hi>Exod.</hi> 33. 18, 22, 23.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Nor doth one and the ſame Believer, enjoy the ſame degree of this nearneſs at all times; <hi>Moſes</hi> had fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with God, before that time his face did ſhine; ſo the Diſciples who were on the Mount, muſt come down and take ſhare with other Believers, of that which was ordinary; you may be ſitting under Chriſts ſhaddow with great delight this day, and in a little time crying
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:65303:43"/> out, <hi>ſaw ye him whom my ſoul loveth, my beloved had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn himſelf, and was gone.</hi> Cant. 5. 6.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Sometimes Believers do not diſcern in the very time, how near they are unto God, and he to them. Gen. 28. 18. <hi>Surely the Lord is in this place, and I knew it not.</hi> And ſometimes he maketh them know diſtinctly, that they have fellowſhip with him, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 1. and and themſelves can give an account of their fellowſhip, Cant. 3. 4. <hi>I found him whom my ſoul loveth, I held him,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="8">8. There is ſometimes ſtrengthning communion with Chriſt, when their comfort is not ſo great as at other times; Pſal. 138. 3. <hi>In the day when I cryed, thou an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweredſt me, and ſtrengthnedſt me with ſtrength in my ſoul.</hi> Here is prayer, and an anſwer to it, which is bleſſed communion with God, and is made out by the ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the ſoul; ſo <hi>Paul</hi> 2 Cor. 12. 8. He <hi>beſought the Lord thrice,</hi> and obtaineth a ſtrengthning anſwer verſ. 9. <hi>My grace is ſufficient for thee;</hi> this the Lord ſaid to him, giving it him as his anſwer: this alſo was true commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and ſometimes there is great delight in this fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip, the Lord is free to diſpoſe of it as he will. Cant. 2. 3. <hi>I ſat under his ſhaddow with great delight.</hi> Pſ. 63. 7. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou hast been my help, therefore in the ſhaddow of thy wings will I rejoyce.</hi> Who can but rejoyce, when they know they are admitted to ſuch an habitation, the wings of the Almighty ſpread about them: Its alſo ſeriouſly to be obſerved, that when the Children of God make mention of their great joy in communion with him, they are found uſually clearing the ſoundneſs of their joy, by the gracious help that their ſouls partake of; ſo in this Scripture, becauſe thou haſt been my help, I find it was true communion I had, by the help I got; and therefore it is allowed joy. Pſal. 28. 7. <hi>My heart truſted in him, and I am helped: therefore my heart greatly rejoyceth.</hi> Here is communion with the Lord, for his heart truſted, and the Lord helped; and finding this help, he greatly rejoyceth. Its neceſſary for the people of God to try any joy they have in holy duti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, whence it ariſeth: becauſe ſome may have delight in acts of worſhip, and yet have no fellowſhip with God, as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58. 2. And many are apt
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:65303:44"/> to think, if they have joy and pleaſure in theſe duties, that then doubtleſs they have fellowſhip with God, which becometh a ſnare to them, not conſidering the deep deceit and hypocriſie of mans heart, which can eaſily ſtretch it ſelf in the externals of Religion, and that with pleaſure, that thereby they may think themſelves reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, as well as to be thought ſo by others; this yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them ſome delight, and ſo much the more, that notwithſtanding of all they perform in Religion, they can reſerve their luſts, and Idols of heart entire, even the whoriſh woman can delight in her peace-offerings to God, that ſhe may have the more peace in her wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs. <hi>Prov.</hi> 7. 14, 15. Its her delight that ſhe can pleaſe God well enough with a ſhow and ceremony of Religion, and her heart and practice go to her own pleaſure therefore; therefore all delight in worſhip is not found, and will not prove fellowſhip with God: for natural Vivacity, the exerciſe of common Gifts, hope that it will pleaſe God, and ſometimes hope of the applauſe of men, may, and doth go a great length to make theſe Duties pleaſant, where there is neither joy in the Lord, nor ſanctifying communion with him: That which is indeed the joy of the Lord, is ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to us, Neh. 8. 10. <hi>The joy of the Lord is your ſtrength.</hi> And if you be admitted to gracious nearneſs, ſo as to behold him, we ſhall thereby be in ſome meaſure, chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into the ſame image, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 18. Theſe ſpiritual advances in godlineſe, and conformity to the image of the Son of God, are the ſafeſt indications and proofs of the truth of our communion with God.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Conſider alſo, that this Communion with God is to be found, both in our worſhip and walk; for where he recordeth his Name, he cometh to his people, he meeteth with them, <hi>and bleſſeth them.</hi> Exod. 29. 43. As alſo in their practice, <hi>Iſai. 64. 5. He meeteth him that rejoyceth and worketh righteouſneſs:</hi> theſe things being premiſed, let us now conſider, how this bleſſed Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion between Chriſt and believers doth appear.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> There is a peculiar knowledge, that Chriſt and Believers have of each other, <hi>John 10. 14. I am the</hi>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:65303:44"/> 
               <hi>good ſhepherd, I know my ſheep, and am known of mine;</hi> Though he knoweth all things, yet he knoweth them in in a ſpecial manner, with approbation: and for his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, becauſe they are rejected, he ſaith, <hi>Matth 7. 23. Depart, I know yow not.</hi> And therefore he Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſteth himſelf, where he deſigns to make abode, <hi>Joh. 14. 21, 23. They know his voice, Cant. 2. 8. The voice of my beloved! behold he cometh:</hi> and <hi>verſe</hi> 14. He knoweth their voice, <hi>Let me hear thy voice, for ſweet is thy voice;</hi> ſtrangers who never converſe, know not the voice of one another: they who are His, know His voice, that they <hi>(will)</hi> follow his voice, and will flie from the voice of a ſtranger, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 45. They know his voice when he ſpeaketh to them by his Ordinances, and when they obſerve his voice, there they attend; knowing the danger of ſouls, to take the voice of ſtrangers for his: they know his call and knock, <hi>Cant. 5. 2, It is the voice of my beloved that knocketh, ſaying, Open to me:</hi> and he underſtandeth their ſecret moans, <hi>Jer. 31. 18. I have heard Ephrain bemoaning himſelf,</hi> Thus Chriſt and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers have a peculiar way of acquaintance, that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to others.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They mutually mind others in love, he hath them ever <hi>graven on the palms of his hands: Iſai.</hi> 49. 16. And they remember him in his ways, and theſe the Lord meeteth with, <hi>Iſai. 64. 5. Thou meeteſt him that rejoyceth and worketh righteouſneſs, thoſe that remember thee in thy ways:</hi> He is the good High Prieſt, that beareth the names of his people on his heart, and the deſire of their ſoul goeth toward him: <hi>Iſai.</hi> 26. 8. It is the Believers great joy, to think that he mindeth him, <hi>Pſal. 40. 17. I am poor and needy, yet the Lord thinketh upon me:</hi> how ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is it to cordial friends, when they are aſſured that what ever they be, yet are affectionatly minded by a friend of worth: If a man live until moſt of his intimate friends are gone, what a bare comfortleſs World do they leave him: when friends and familiars are put far from him, he ſees none that he can unboſom his ſoul to, this maketh the World like a very wilderneſs to him: but here is a brother born for the day of adverſity; when father
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:65303:45"/> and mother, or moſt Sympathizing friends are removed, yet he is the ſame, yeſterday, to day, and for ever, he ſupplieth all; and often deareſt friends are removed from Believers, that Chriſt himſelf may be their all, that himſelf may have their heart and fellowſhip more intirely; they uſed to run to their Sympathizing friends with every grief, and it may be before they went to Chriſt with it, which Chriſt obſerving in any with whom he determines fellowſhip, turneth the Ciſterns utterly dry one way or another, and then the man muſt come to the Fountain, or faint: Bleſſed Jeſus loves to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred by his people, he writeth a Book of remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, for them who thought upon his Name, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 16. Complaines when they forget him, <hi>Jer. 2. 32. My people have forgotten me days without number:</hi> But when his people come to be well acquainted with the bleſſings of his fellowſhip, <hi>the meditation of him becomes ſweet,</hi> Pſal. 104. 34. The love they have to him, makes remembering of him habitual, native, and in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect eaſie: rather a pain to be long without thoughts of him, and the ſame love makes it moſt uneaſie to be forgotten by him; it is as Death to them, if they think their Lord forgetteth them, <hi>Pſal. 88 5. Free among the dead, like the ſlain that lie in the grave, whom thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membereſt no more:</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. There is pains taken for this bleſſed fellowſhip on both ſides, though the unequality be greater than we can imagine; he being at the greateſt Pains and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, who hath no need of ſuch company, yet he is found ſtanding and knocking at our Door, purſuing this fellowſhip, <hi>Rev. 3. 20. Behold, I ſtand at the Door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the Door, I well come in to him, and will ſup with him, and he with me.</hi> It is Communion with thee I am ſeeking, and let me have it: I will Sup with thee, and it ſhall not be at thy Charges, I will bear the Coſt, all is provided, and you ſhall find it meat indeed: how many wonders are in this love, that the Prince of the Kings of the Earth ſhould thus urge our nearneſs! as if he were to have ſome great Prize, is this the manner of men? Where did you ever
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:65303:45"/> hear of a King in poſſeſſion of his Kingdom and Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, come to a poor mans Door, and ſtand there wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for a word of him, or to let him in to do him good: I think this paſſeth all thoughts, but ſilent Admiration, yet he ſtandeth there till he complain, <hi>that his Locks are wet with the drops of the night,</hi> Cant. 5. 2. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth the wonder, but however wonderful, glory to God that we ſafely may and muſt believe it; on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand, the Believer having taſted of the bleſſings of his fellowſhip, cryeth out, <hi>O when wilt thou come unto me?</hi> Pſal 101. 2 and <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 7. Let me know where thou feedeſt, that I may feed there, I can feed no where but where thou art, this meeting cannot but hold at laſt, when both are on the way to other.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And when the Believer doth ſo meet with Chriſt, as that he knoweth he is come, by the lifting up of his countenance, with how great joy is he received, Iſa. 12. 1. <hi>Tho' thou waſt angry, yet thou haſt turned away from thine anger, and comforted me; now thou art become my ſong and my ſalvation:</hi> how meanly do they think of any pains they have been at, in ſeeking after him? <hi>Cant. 3. 4. It was but a little farther that I went, and I found him whom my ſoul loveth.</hi> If it were to do, I would go on tho' I ſhould be torn by the way; for it's as life from the dead, when he cometh and bringeth healing under his wings, then it is that they ſit down under his ſhad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow with great delight, his countenance is the health of their countenance. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42. 11. Then their Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces have a reviving and a new Spring; then their Spik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard caſteth forth its ſmell, <hi>when the king ſitteth at his table.</hi> Cant. 1. 12. Then it is that worldly Comforts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come inſipid, and of no value; then it is they ſay, <hi>what have</hi> I <hi>to do any more with idols?</hi> Hoſ. 14. 8. When they ſit under his ſhaddow, they know then that no idols ever gave them ſuch entertainment; then they can ſay their Lines are fallen in pleaſant places. What out of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven can be compared to that complyancy between Chriſt and Believers, when they can without terrour, converſe with God, and ſolace their ſouls in him? <hi>He delighting in them,</hi> Iſa. 62. 4. And <hi>they delighting in him,</hi> Iſa. 58. 14.
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:65303:46"/> And commanded to do it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37. 4. This made the godly Martyers go through Flames chearfully to the full poſſeſſion of this Fellowſhip.</p>
            <p n="5">5. In this Communion, there is great freedom on both ſides: the Lord allowing them to pour out their hearts before him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62. 8. And they accordingly, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 142. 2, 3. I <hi>poured out my complaint before him,</hi> I <hi>ſhewed before him my trouble, When my ſpirit was over whelmed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in me, then thou kneweſt my path.</hi> They willingly expoſe all that is in their heart before him, and are content he ſearch them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139. 23. It would be an affliction to them, if their neareſt friends knew all that is in their hearts; but a ſincere Soul deſires to conceal nothing from him, but rather deſires his help to ſearch, fearing there may be evils in them which they cannot ſearch out them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they dare not proudly boaſt, as if nothing evil were to be found in them, but humbly beg that he would ſee and heal, what they ſee not, and ſo far as they know, they lay their hearts open before him, their moſt ſecret ſins, complaining how they prevail againſt them, ſuch evils as they could reveal to none on earth: ſo alſo their Doubts and Temptations, their Griefs, their Fears, and what they deſire moſt, all their deſire is before him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 38. 9. And bleſſed Jeſus Chriſt is faithful to them, and free with them, both as to neceſſary reproofs, <hi>I have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what againſt thee,</hi> Rev. 2. 4.</p>
            <p>And as to encouragement, <hi>Thou haſt a little ſtrength, and haſt kept my word,</hi> Rev. 3. 8. <hi>and</hi> Pſal. 25. 14. He ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them his Covenant, he openeth it up to their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, and there they find all their Salvation, there they find relief as to their Sins, Doubts, and Fears, there they find their victory ſecured, for, <hi>The ſecret of tho Lord is with them that fear him: and he will ſhew them his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. In this Communion, there is ſtill deſire for more nearneſs to Chriſt, <hi>Cant. 8. 6. Set me as a ſeal upon thy heart.</hi> What boldneſs of Love is? Oh, is there nothing will ſatisfie leſs than Chriſts heart! They muſt be placed there, for his love is their happineſs. 2. They deſire it may be made evident for their comfort as by a Seal, that
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:65303:46"/> thereby they may read his deſires is toward them, this ſecureth their comfort, when they can ſay, <hi>his deſire is towards me, Cant.</hi> 7. 10. If it be thought never ſo great ambition, yet ſincere love to Chriſt is kept in pain with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome evidence of the love of his heart; his mercies are ſweet, his graces very ſweet, but his heart is ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of all. I queſtion, if there be any ſincere love to Chriſt, where this is not deſired, though ſuch an habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, ſuch a ſeat as the heart of Chriſt cannot be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed without admiration. 3. When it's ſaid ſet me as a Seal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That is, ratiſie, and confirm this my Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in thee, and Communion with thee, as by a Seal, that thy love ſhal be my allowance, and Communion with thee, my priviledge for ever. 4. When it's ſaid, ſet thou me as a Seal, is as much as an humble acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Lord I cannot place my ſelf where I would be, I cannot bring my own ſoul to this near Communion with thee, but I commit it to thee, who can draw my heart to thy heart, I truſt thy efficacious power, that what ever be my natural averſneſs to ſuch holy Communion, yet my heart is under thy dominion, thou canſt prepare and form it for thy ſelf, all this Salvation is thy own doing, &amp; thou canſt bear me up to this eminent part of it, to be ſo near as on thy heart: Therefore it's my humble requeſt, that thou ſet me there, the Spouſe doth not ſay, I will ſet my ſelf there, but ſet thou me as a Seal <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It's obſervable, that after <hi>Moſes</hi> had near Communion with God on the Mount, yet he ſtill preſſeth for more, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33. 13. I <hi>beſeech thee ſhew me thy glory.</hi> What he had obtained, did but excite his deſires for more: and ſo it is with all who have the true beginning of Communion with God in this life, though they have it not in the manner <hi>Moſes</hi> had, the Communications that Believers receive here are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries of a greater beauty and glory yet before them, &amp; theſe foretaſts captivate their love and deſire, ſo as they cannot but purſue for greater diſcoveries, the firſt fruits they have found, are ſo ſweet to their taſte, that the more they get, the more they hunger, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 23.</p>
            <p n="7">7. That which Believers obtain in Communion with God, is ſo ſtrengthning and comfortable, that the hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:65303:47"/> of his face is moſt bitter, <hi>Pſal. 30: 7. Thou didſt hide thy face, and I was troubled.</hi> If there be no grief of heart upon the hiding of his Face, there is juſt cauſe of fear, that ſuch perſons have not known the ſhining of his Face; as on the other hand, theſe who diligently obſerve the Lords withdrawing from their ſouls, and are forthwith pained and wounded for his abſence; do thereby teſtifie their acquaintance with the bleſſings of his preſence, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially, if their grief be that they have provoked him to withdraw, &amp; that his withdrawing is not only as to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, but as to the meaſure of ſtrengthning Grace former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy allowed them, the very fear of the Lords deſerting, doth often mix water in the beſt of their wine, that until Chriſt and they be at home in their Fathers Kingdom, their bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and moſt ſerene days, are often overcaſt with clouds; and therefore, when they do enjoy his gracious preſence, fearing ſome alteration, though not of their fixed graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous eſtate, yet of their preſent bleſſings, cry out, <hi>Stir not up, nor awake my love, till,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 7. O that he would ſtay, and not leave my ſoul deſtitute, and when the Cloud covereth them, O what a damp it giveth, then Darkneſs, Jealouſies, &amp; Fears ariſe, as <hi>Job 29. 1. O that I were as in moneths paſt, when his candle ſhined on my head,</hi> ver. 2, 3, 4. <hi>As I was in the days of my youth, when the ſecret of God was upon my Tabernacle, when the Almighty was yet with me.</hi> This godly mans deſires were fulfilled, for <hi>Job 4. 2. So the Lord turned the captivity of Job,</hi> and ver. 12. <hi>bleſſed his latter end more than his beginning.</hi> But many now come to old age, are almoſt hopleſs, that they ſhal ever in this life be, as in the days of their youth, and decline ſo far, that they tempt themſelves to doubt if ever the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty was with them, and his ſecret on their Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Where true Communion with God is, there its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection is deſired, not only to have that meaſure continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which is here allowed, but to be for ever with the Lord, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. 18. Here their Fellowſhip is but as ſeeing through a Glaſs, there it's often interrupted, as to its comforts, here a body of ſin is ſtill preſſing them downward to this Earth, that they get not their Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:65303:47"/> ſtaid and fixed on things Above, here they are ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with ſnares and temptations, ſuch as have made ſtrong Cedars to ſhake; And therefore having already the firſt fruits of a better Countrey, they deſire to be where he is, who hath taken up their hearts to himſelf: For to be with Chriſt, they ſincerely think beſt of all, and <hi>Heb. 11. 16. But now they deſire a better countrey, that is an heavenly,</hi> It's not ſome extraordinary perſons only, who are of this mind, but all true Believers, for <hi>Rev. 22: 17. The ſpirit and the bride ſay, Come,</hi> Chriſt ſaith, I come quickly, and they agree, even ſo come Lord Jeſus. <hi>The crown of righteouſneſs is laid up for all who love his appearing, 2 Tim.</hi> 4. 8. So that it's dangerous for a Chriſtian to want deſires of this nature, for they are conſiſtent with ſubmiſſion to his appointed time; but ſince the Crown is laid up for ſuch as love his appearing, every Chriſtian is concerned to try, whether the meditations of that day be his terrour or delight, theſe being a few of the great bleſſings found in Communion with God; there remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth yet one difficulty which perplexeth ſome ſerious ſouls: that is how to have this bleſſed Communion ordinary, ſo as they may be ſaid to walk with God, knowing that this walking with him is more than to perform ſome ſtated Duties of VVorſhip; the grounds whence this difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ariſeth, are;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> They hear and read of abideing in Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 4. Setting the Lord always before our eyes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. 8. of waiting on God continually, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 12. 6. of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorting continually unto him, <hi>Pſal:</hi> 71: 3: When they think on ſuch Scriptures, and withal the regard God hath to ſuch as remember him in his ways, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64. 5. And ſuch as thought on his Name, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3: 16. And his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation againſt theſe who forget God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. 22. Theſe and the like paſſages being laid to heart, they think that God ſhould be always actually remembred, &amp; ſome few find great diſquiet, if any conſiderable portion of time be ſpent without thoughts of God.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, they find themſelves concerned in worldly affairs, or Reading, Studying, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be managed without ſerious and ſuitable thoughts to
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:65303:48"/> the work they are about; God clearly calleth them to theſe other things, it were ſin in them to ruine their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, and neglect the duties of their ſtation, ſome of which duties may require a conſiderable portion of time, and ſeriouſneſs in that time: now their ſtrait is how to manage theſe external neceſſary Duties, without ſinful forgetting of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Whatever weakneſs may be found in this difficulty, yet it appears to flow from a good root of love to God, and fellowſhip with him, it's a ſavoury kind of trouble, yet;</p>
            <p n="2">2. It's not ſafe for a Chriſtian, to arraign himſelf for a forgetter of God, when he is ſerving God in the duties of his ſtation, but;</p>
            <p n="3">3. It will be found, that the bittereſt ingredient of this accuſation is, when there is opportunity for remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring God, without obſtructing any other duty, that theſe opportunities are not improved: and for the help of ſuch who find trouble of this nature, as I know ſome for many years afflicted with it. I ſhal propoſe but theſe 4 things, leaving their uſefulneſs to the bleſſing of God. 1. The continued exerciſe of the love of God, 2. Perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our external Duties as obedience to God. 3. Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent retirements to God, and 4. many ejaculations.</p>
            <p>For the Firſt, The lively exerciſe of the love of God, makes the remembrance of him delectable; a Chriſtian hath a great advantage, when the deſire of his ſoul goes to it, for then he is ſo far from grudging that God have his affectionat thoughts, that he cannot be eaſily kept from them, this being one of the ſtrong conſtraints of Love, to think on the object Beloved, you may obſerve the Spouſe in the Book of <hi>Canticles</hi> cannot be kept long from the thoughts of her Beloved; either ſeeking after him, or delighting in his Fellowſhip, or commending him to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; Chriſts love is the ſureſt Bond on the ſoul, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent ſinful forgetting, and if it decay, your thoughts and meditations will decay with it; but vigorous love will make you both embrace, and ſeek for opportunities of converſe with him, and the meditations of him ſweet, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104. 34.</p>
            <pb n="77" facs="tcp:65303:48"/>
            <p>For the <hi>2d,</hi> Even our external duties, ſhould be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed as obedience to God: Therefore, 1. Take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in hand, but what is Duty. 2. And preſent Duty, for God hath appointed a ſeaſon for every Work, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 3. 4. 3. Do what is Duty, becauſe it's Duty, becauſe God requireth it: For a man may do that which upon the matter is Duty, and yet not to do it, becauſe God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth it; and then he cannot be ſaid to ſerve God, there is need to advert to this, for it's a great mean of peace to a mans Conſcience, when he knoweth that which he hath been employed in, was the very work God called him into; and therefore he engaged in it, and though it were a worldly concern, and did take a conſiderable time, and intent thoughts; yet he is not to think all this time was ſinfully ſpent, becauſe he was not on the meditations of God all that time, for God called him to be about o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, which could not be performed without the thoughts of his mind. 4. Theſe external affairs ſhould be attended no longer than Duty requires: This alſo ſhould be conſidered, leſt love to the World keep your minds hanging upon them longer than need requireth, this becometh a ſnare, and a great obſtruction to Fellowſhip with God; you need fear nothing that God Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, will of itſelf marr your Spiritual good; for his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands are, <hi>For our good always, Deut.</hi> 6, 24. But fear thy own miſmanagement, and weakneſs in making Duties to interfer, and juſtle out one another: Seek therefore to get thy heart inclined to perform his Statutes always, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 112. Be always about ſeaſonable Duty, give no allowance to idleneſs, and vain thoughts; for it's miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpending of time, and being out of all manner of Duty, that doth moſt procure theſe diſquieting reflection; for if thou be conſcientiouſly ſerving God, and working righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, then thou ſhalt find peace and quietneſs, as <hi>Iſa. 22. 17. And the work of righteouſneſs ſhall be peace, and the effect of righteouſneſs, quietneſs and aſſurance for ever;</hi> Yea, the Lord will meet with thee, when thou art per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming works of righteouſneſs, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64. 5. Thy acting of Juſtice and performing Duties to men, ſhal not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct thy Fellowſhip with God, for he meeteth with ſuch.</p>
            <pb n="78" facs="tcp:65303:49"/>
            <p>For the third Help which is frequent retiring to God in Secret Worſhip, pray always <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 1. and 1 Theſſ. 5. 17. <hi>Pray without ceaſing,</hi> this requireth more than only a Praying diſpoſition, for a meer diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is not the acting of Prayer which is required, though I grant this diſpoſition is required in the Command of Praying always; and if there be not a diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and willingneſs, Prayer will ſoon be but a burden, and if there be an inclination and diſpoſition, Prayer will be frequent where God giveth an opportunity, <hi>David</hi> not only Prayeth three times a day, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55. 17. but prayeth ſeven times a day, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 164. which appeareth to be ſtated ordinary times for Worſhip daily: there is great guilt on many for ſeldom praying, who have times at will, &amp; ſometimes knows not how to ſpend it; they can tell you they weary, they think long, they know not what to fall about, how to put off time, they will go to ſuch a place or ſuch a company only to put off time, and yet very ſeldom retiring to ſecret Prayer: have you no concerns with God? have ye all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him that ye deſire? have ye nothing to aſk of him? or nothing to Praiſe him for? how Juſt will it be with God to cut thee out of theſe opportunities, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by ſudden Death, or caſt thee in ſuch Sickneſs and pain, that it ſhal be more than thou canſt to bear thy Affl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The <hi>4th.</hi> Help for this Communion with God in our walk, is frequent ejaculatory prayer: when there is not opportunity for retireing to Worſhip, theſe may be very numerous, and are more numerous than can be well counted by a walk with God, who hath acquired a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious habit of making his requeſt known to God in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 6. by this kind of Prayer, a man may often minde God, without any detriment or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to his other concerns, the Motions of the ſoul be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſwift, when <hi>Jacob</hi> is predicting the Lot of his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. 18. and ſpeaking to them, there's no loſs to his work by that pathetick and pertinent Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſuch as do all their works in the Lord, cannot but frequently mind him. Pious <hi>Nehemiah</hi> 2. 4. when in the preſence of a great Monarch, hath his ſhort Prayer to the God of heaven, there being no ſeaſon then for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring and Bowing his knee to his Maker; yet he will not manage his Deſign without ſome application to God; no company could keep him from his God, on whom his dependance was, <hi>This Example might Inſtruct in Many Things, for 1.

Yet now in the preſence of the King he prayeth again, many ſuch as we would be ready to think we have pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for this already, what needeth more prayer, and there's no opportunity for prayer now, and ſo let it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, but he will not utter his Requeſt till he pray again, 2. He was Surpriſed with the King's unexpected demand <hi>verſe 4. For what dost thou make requeſt; When ever we are ſurpriſed, we ſhould go firſt to God, whatever company we are in. 3 He was in great fear,</hi> Chap. 2. 2. <hi>Then I was very ſore afraid, and therefore betaketh himſelf immediately to God as a preſent Help and Refuge, and if we would do ſo in our fears, it would much ſtrengthen our Communion with God. 4. That which he was concern'd in was of great Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and therefore beſought God to be concerned in it, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould we attempt any thing of moment without applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

Here was an opportunity offered for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good, and he muſt go to God for Direction, how to manage it, his Deſign was now much Ripened, when the King deſires to know his Requeſt, and leſt by his weakneſs he ſhould obſtruct the good of others, he Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſeth himſelf to God for Counſel, ſo ſhould we when ever, and whereſoever occaſion Offereth to be uſeful in the Wor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>SEing ſuch Bleſſed and near Communion with Chriſt may be obtained at the Lord's Table, then Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicants ſhould prepare for entertaining Communion with him in the time of that Solemnity, after ſerious prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration great Diligence is neceſſary, that this Holy Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance be managed on our part in an acceptable man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that we may find it a true Communion with Chriſt, ſuitable to it's name, and of all Communicants they have the moſt peculiar advantage, who are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with Communion with God before they come to the Lord's Table; for except there be ſome admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable work of power and Mercy, men will ſurely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane the Sacrament, who have their Fellowſhip with Chriſt then to begin, not knowing how to receive Chriſt when they receive theſe Sacred ſigns, or how to Feed upon him: I ſay without ſome great work of God's Mercy, for we muſt ſtill leave place for Soveraign Power and Mercy, who can not only Confirm ſuch as have doubted of their Fellowſhip with God; but even then give it a Beeing which had no Beeing before; and in one day or hour give both Faith and Fellowſhip with God: yet this is no Warrant for any to preſume with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out endeavouring both Faith and Fellowſhip before they come to the Lord's Table.</p>
            <p>It ſhould alſo be remarked that many godly perſons find themſelves at a great loſs when they come to the Lord's Table, by not knowing how to act their part di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly in Communicating, and though they have made ſome Conſcience of Preparation before, yet complains they act but confuſedly in the very time of the Solemn Action, which doth much obſtruct their Peace and
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:65303:51"/> Comfort, yea, though they dare not Charge themſelves with Hypocriſie as to their deſires for Communion with Chriſt, or that they were altogether inconcern'd in Partaking; yet not knowing what Meditations were moſt ſuitable in the time of Partaking, and wandring from one thought to another without fixing on that which was moſt proper for the work, do often fall into im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinecies alien to the great work in hand, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Reflected upon, giveth ſuch a Wound to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, that the day or hour which ſhould have been the time of their great Joy, is turned into Grief and Complaints: and that which will appear ſtrange unto Strangers to theſe things, that ſome find more dificulty to be Compoſed in their minds in the very time of that Solemnity, than they found before they came to it; whereby they are Surpriſed and fall into great Conſternation, that when the Soul ſhould have been moſt United, Fixed, and elevated for Communion with Chriſt, that than their thoughts ſhould be a ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering: though poſſibly the things they were think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of were Pious and Good in themſelves, but altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unſeaſonable: ſuch would Conſider that Feeding on Chriſt is ſo excellent and profitable for the Soul, and ſo Deſtructive for Satan's Intereſt, that no De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices or Temptations will be wanting to fruſtrat that Profite; and therefore ſhould be Guarded againſt, not onely to Reſiſt Temptations in the time, or any thing Impertinent to the Work in hand, but withall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we come to Partake, this ſhould have a peculiar Conſideration, how we ſhould Act in the time of that Solemn Action: and who knoweth but the Neglect of this part of Preparation may provock God to let us find our own Weakneſs to our Grief, if we be ſo proud as to think we can Act the Moſt Solemn part of the Work of our ſelves, without any Preparation, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it will be found our Duty both to Pray, and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate before hand, how to be Employed in the time of Receiving: and ſuch are in a ſpecial manner con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to notice this who have Smarted already for it's Neglect, complaining that God had Deſerted them, for
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:65303:51"/> no other reaſon but becauſe of their Impertinent wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring at the Lord's Table.</p>
            <p>And for your help in this part of the Work, how to Act your part of this Holy Communion, I ſhall propoſe by the Lord's help, a few things to your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, I ſay how to Act, leſt any ſhould ſay there's no Acting required of us but only Receiving: but ſuch would Conſider, that our Receiving of Chriſt is the Acting of Faith, as is clear from <hi>John</hi> 1. 12<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Wherein alſo Love to our Bleſſed Redeemer muſt be Acted, ſo that we muſt Act our part in this Holy Communion, if we expect the Benefite for which alſo we ſhould be active in Praiſes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Then when we are to enter on this Bleſſed Duty, we ſhould humbly requeſt for the Lord's Aſiſtance and Preſence with us, that our hearts may be Eſtabliſhed by his Grace, and kept cloſs to the Work; this ſhould be done were there never ſo many about you.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It's neceſſary alſo that what the Lord ſendeth by his Meſſengers for clearing the Nature of the Sacrament be Diligently hearkened unto; and I do the rather mind you of this, becauſe ſome do then ſhut their ears from attending to any thing ſpoken, being wholly taken up with thoughts of their own: I am not yet ſpeaking of the very Inſtant of Receiving, for at that time People muſt be exerciſed with their own Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ſhould not be diverted with many Words, but that which I ſay, is that before the Sacred Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be engaged, ſome take a liberty to Neglect all they hear, attending only to their own ſecret thoughts and debates: but this is not the ſeaſonable Work, for if it be Miniſters Duty to Preach, and open up the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Sacrament, and teach the Duty of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants, then it's the Peoples Duty to hearken, not knowing but the Lord will Direct that unto them, which may either clear their preſent Doubts, or ſet them on ſome more ſeaſonable Work than that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they are at preſent Exerciſed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. When ye are entering the Work labour to come to it cheerfully and thankfully, Bleſſing God you have
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:65303:52"/> ſo Bleſſed a Work to go to, as actual Solemn Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with Chriſt, and that the Lord himſelf hath brought you into the Banqueting-houſe, <hi>Cant. 2. 4. He brought me to the Banqueting-houſe.</hi> This is Comfortable when a Communicant is ſo far cleared, that the Lord hath brought him there, begin it with hope of a Comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able meeting with Chriſt; it's a feaſt of Love where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thou a Believer and lover of him mayeſt find his Banner of Love ſpread over thee, and himſelf a covert from the Tempeſt of all Temptations that may aſſault thee.</p>
            <p n="4">4. When thou art to Partake that thy Meditations may be Pertinent and ſuitable to this Holy Action, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to have thy thoughts agreeable to the Inſtitution it ſelf, conſidering the Elements and what they Repreſent, and pondering the very Words of the Inſtitution, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe Words of Chriſt's Inſtitution point out thy preſent work, and what ſhould be the nature of thy Meditations; nor canſt thou partake aright if thy mind be not Exerciſed with what Chriſt ſpeaketh in that Action, beſides that, this will be the Bleſſing of God an hedge in the way, to keep thee from Impertinent excurſions, and unſeaſonable thoughts, but no hedge to the Breathings of God's Spirit or Limiting of him, for thou art to expect moſt of the Spirit's help when thou art cloſs at thy Duty, and this is the preſent Duty to Meditate on the Words of Chriſt ſpoken by him at the Celebration of this Ordinance, and to be ſuitably affected with them.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And more particularly when thou ſeeſt the Bread broken, and readeſt or heareſt that word, <hi>this is my Body which is broken,</hi> then thou art to Meditate on Chriſt Cruciſied his Bleſſed broken Body, and Bleeding Wounds, and ſo to Behold him as in exquiſite pain, Crying out of being Forſaken, Mocked, and Tempted by the Wicked to come out of that pain, and relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh the work, Mat. 27. 48. <hi>If thou be the Son of God, come down from the Croſs.</hi> Thus we are to Behold him, and Mourn for the deep hand we had In all his Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, we having Pierced him, are oblidged to Look
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:65303:52"/> and Mourn, and this mourning with Admiration of that Love that provided ſo Coſtly a Remedy for us, and lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him who made his Soul an Offering for ſin is a part of our acting this Bleſſed Communion with Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="6">6. When thou heareſt that Bleſſed Word (take) and that by taking the Bread, thou art to take Chriſt himſelf; here thou art to Meditate on the Great Offer made to thee, and to Believe in thine heart, that now the Redeemer and Saviour of the World Offereth Himſelf to thee, and requireth thee to take Him; as He gave Himſelf for thee, ſo now He giveth himſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee: this giving, and thy Receiving is the very Acting of this Bleſſed Communion, He giveth Himſelf to be thine for ever, and ſo thou Receives; He gives Himſelf intirely with all His Purchaſe, and ſo thou by Faith Receives, thou comeſt with the Senſe of thy Sin and Guilt, and He giveth the Benefit of His Blood to Cleanſe thee from all Sin; Thou comeſt with the Senſe of thy Diſeaſes and thy Sins often prevailing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee, and out of His fulneſs thou receiveſt Grace, by Receiving Him thou haſt a Right to all the Bleſſings purchaſed as thy need Requires here, and a Right to Glory, which in due time thou ſhalt Poſſeſs, ſetting thee down together with Him in Heavenly places, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 6. O Bleſſed Communion begun here on Earth, and ſhortly to be perfected in that Eternal Communion where there ſhal be no more paining diſtance.</p>
            <p n="7">7. When thou heareſt that Word (eat) and thereby Chriſt ſaying take me into thy heart, eat, and be Satisfied, now fill thy hungry Soul, eat abundantly, make Room, open for me, <hi>I will come in and ſup with thee,</hi> and the Meat ſhal be my Fleſh, <hi>Meat indeed:</hi> What a pain is it ſometimes to a Believer that he cannot duely va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue this Love, even when he valueth it moſt; and therefore will Eat and Wonder, and VVonder and Eat, but dare not for all his wondering ſay Lord it's too Good for me, I dare not touch or eat it, no no ſaith the Believer my Life is in it, I cannot want it, let His gifts be like Himſelf, though I be ſtill like my ſelf
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:65303:53"/> meer nought: I find Him ſaying, if I eat not His Fleſh I have no Life in me, <hi>John</hi> 6. 53. Therefore I will chooſe Life and Eat; and whatever may be ſaid of eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt's Fleſh when a man believeth, yet I will eat in this manner, becauſe he Requireth it, He hath o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened my heart and prepared His place in my Soul, O let him come and Poſſeſs His own Conqueſt, and ſince he alloweth to take and eat, I will do it, I will take Him into my very heart, that I may Live, and Live to Him for ever, and I do Requeſt Him to take deep Poſſeſſion of all the Powers of my Soul by the Graces of his Spirit, and animate them all for His Service, as meat is diffuſed through the Body, for it's ſervice. Here is intimate Communion with Chriſt in His Ordinance.</p>
            <p n="8">8. VVhen that overcoming word is heard (for you) broken for you; Chriſt Himſelf making Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the great Sacrifice to thee, as this goeth deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt into the heart, ſo it raiſeth the greateſt Admiration that it was for me even for me, who was not only worthleſs, but a Rebel and diſhonourer of Him; this cutteth through the heart, giving it a deep Loves wound, was I then in His thoughts and upon his heart? and did He thus Suffer for me who acted againſt Him for ſo many years? and reſiſted as I could His Love, when purſued by it? what ſhal I now render to the Lord, what can I render, what have I to render, but what is His own? and that ſame I often keep back, how good is it that by what I now receive I ſhal be qualified to Extoll His Love in another manner, and in a better place, though my Praiſes cannot through Eternity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſe His Love, for He is above our Bleſſing and praiſe, only I ſhal take pleaſure to Sound out His Praiſes before Angels and men, when I am taught the Song of the Lamb; I am this day deep Debitour to His Love, and ſhal be ſo for ever, I ſhal Glory in it, and ſpend, but cannot out-ſpend Eternity in acknowledging this Debt, that His Precious Body was Broken for me, and Himſelf allowing me now to Believe it: This is alſo a part of the Believers Communion with Chriſt at His Table.</p>
            <p n="9">
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:65303:53"/>9. VVhen thou heareſt theſe words, <hi>This do in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of Me.</hi> I Conſider who Requireth this, is it not He who Remembred me in my low eſtate, wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing in my Blood, and no eye to pity me but His, Remembring me when I was not remembring my ſelf, nor come to my ſelf to conſider my forlorn eſtate, when my wretched ſelf, and all the World about, me would let me Sink into the Pit whence there is no Redemption, no man caring for my Soul, is not this He who Remembreth me ſtill? hath He not mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifully Remembred me this day in bringing me here where I find the Bread of Life? hath he not now made me taſte of that Tree of Life which ſhal be food for ever? and all by His Gracious Remembring of me, and ſhal I not Remember His Love more than Wine, no thanks to me, O Lord to Remember Thee, and thy Love, hadſt thou required me to paſs through ſome flames of a Hell, it were my part to eſſay it at thy Command, how much more when I have nothing but Love to remember, ſhal not I remember thy unquench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Love, who haſt reſcued me from unquenchable Flames? I have many times VVretchedly done what I could to quench thy Love, but many waters hath not done it, I do remember it Lord, and through thy Grace will remember it, and I will do this which thou now Requireſt in remembrance of Thee and Thy love, giving Thee thanks for Commanding it, and had I no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe to do in this Ordinance, yet by Thy grace Thy gracious Command ſhal be Anſwered, though in great weakneſs. Here alſo is another part of this Bleſſed Communion, Chriſt requiring remembrance, and the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever cordially yielding it.</p>
            <p n="10">10. And when thou heareſt of the ſhewing forth of His Death, which Chriſt is not aſhamed of, but will have it in this manner Publiſhed; then ſaith the Believer, that Death brought Life to my Soul, that Death hath over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Death for me, that now I may ſay O Death where is thy Sting, by this Death is the Death of Deaths, Hoſ. 13. 14. <hi>O Death I will be thy plague,</hi> and 1 Cor. 15. 54. <hi>Death is ſwallowed up in victory.</hi> Death was long my ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:65303:54"/> and kept me in Bondage, not knowing what hour the firſt and the ſecond Death might ſurpriſe me toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, now when I muſt go through that Paſſage I hope to fear no evil, Chriſt hath Sweetned the Paſſage, made it no Enemy, but a neceſſary ſtep for puting off Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, that I may be Cloathed with incorruption, there ſhal be no Prints of Sin or Death ſeen upon me, no ſpot or wrinkle by the ſhrugs of Death, I ſhal take no ſtench of Death with me where I go, and all this by His Death who was Slain and is Alive: I will this day apply it thankfully, and Solemnly ſhew it Forth: Chriſt Crucified being my Glory, and He who bringeth me to Glory; deſiring in my Soul that His Death were ſhewed Forth, from the Riſing to the Setting of the Sun. Here alſo is a part of this Bleſſed Communion, Chriſt Requiring His Death to be ſhew'd Forth, and the Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver cordially performing it.</p>
            <p n="11">11. VVhen the Believer heareth that the Cup is the New Teſtament in His Blood: Conſidering that by the Death of the Teſtator, the Teſtament is of Force, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 16, 17. The Believer Intereſted in the Legacy, may now with Confidence expect what is bequathed, for the Teſtament thus Confirmed cannot be Diſanulled, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 15. Then ſaith the Believer, I will give Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to the Tokens and Pledges deviſed by Himſelf for my Confirmation; He requireth me to take them as ſuch, and ſo I receive them from Him who is Faithful. I will from henceforth expect all the Promiſed Bleſſings that I ſtand in need of, for in this Covenant or Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is all my Salvation; Chriſt hath made all ſure by His Death, and now He hath made all ſure to me by His Seal: I dare not diſtruſt His Seal or Pledges, He hath made me a Believer, He hath this day given me to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Chriſt Crucified, I have Received Him according to His Offer, He hath given me power to become one of the Children of God, His Teſtament therefore is for me, and it's Seal ſealeth me up unto the day of Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, and here is a comfortable part of this Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Chriſt, He giveth the Pledges and Seal of His Teſtament, and the Believer joyfully receiving them as
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:65303:54"/> ſuch, and Rendering Him Praiſe; the Believer reſolving now to go to Death in humble confidence, <hi>That the Lord hath made an everlaſting Covenant with him, ordered in all things, and ſure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe are but a taſte of the ſeaſonable Meditations in the time of Partaking, and a Help for preventing Imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent wanderings of the Mind; and though a Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant reach not all ſuch particular Meditations at one time, yet one or moe ſuitable ſerious Meditations on Chriſt's words of Inſtitution, will be found by the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of God a mean to keep the Soul at that work, which God then Requireth, and ſo prevent the wounding Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections of many after they have Communicated: for it muſt be ſuppoſed that every Godly Communicant will reviewe the way how his Soul was Imployed at the Lord's Table, and if he find that his Meditations were not oppoſit to the work, it cannot but make a very bitter Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection.</p>
            <p>Know alſo that theſe Meditations already hinted, are but for puting ſome weak People in mind to keep cloſe by the Inſtitution, leſt their thoughts go off their VVork; but no ways intended as any Reſtriction or Limiting of Communicants (except from wandring) for if Chriſt manifeſt Himſelf and entertain thee with His Loves, thou will not need ſuch Helps, for He can ſoon Elevate thy Soul into ſuch Meditations, affections and joy, by the Breathings of His Spirit, as thy ſelf cannot Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, and all of them ſuitable to the Bleſſed work thou art about.</p>

The Love we owe to the Glory of our Bleſſed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer oblidgeth to this deſire, of ſhewing it forth in the manner He hath appointed: yet on this account alſo many are Guilty by the neglect of this Ordinance: for theſe Dangerous miſtakes are too much rooted in many, thinking becauſe they receive Chriſt at any time when they Believe, therefore they need not be ſolicitous for Receiving Him at His Table; and becauſe they may Render Him Glory at other times for His Love in Dying, therefore they need not go to the Lords Supper to perform it: but theſe thoughts involve you in great Guilt, for howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver frequent thy praiſes be at other times, why would thou preſume to wiſer than thy Lord? who hath appointed this Publick Solemn manner of performing it? Dareſt thou ſay in His face Lord I think this way of ſhewing forth thy Death needleſs, I think a more privat way may ſerve? wilt thou Impudently
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:65303:56"/> advance thy own wiſdom as above His? whether doth He or thou know beſt which way He is to be Glorified, whether art thou to give Him Rules or to be Ruled by Him? if thou wilt be ſo arrogant as to plead that thou knoweſt better how to do thy Duty, than he can teach thee; it's no wonder thou have no deſire for the Lords Supper; but rather if thou canſt regard any Goſpel Ordinance, ſince thou art wiſe enough to teach thy ſelf: Think with thy ſelf, I muſt once compear before my Judge, the ſame bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Redeemer who requires his Death to be ſhewed forth, what ſhal I anſwer, when thus charged by him; the juſt died for the unjuſt, I ſubmitted to agony in my ſoul, and torments in my body, to relieve poor ſinners from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal torments; thus my Death was the reconciliation of the whole Elect World, who thereby now ſtand upright in Judgement; I required, that this my Death ſhould be ſhewed forth unto this day, that I am come again: But here is a man that thought it not neceſſary, to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der me that publick honour. What can be thy anſwer, but ſpeechleſs conſternation? Think alſo with thy ſelf, if I expect reconciliation with God by that precious Death, how can I refuſe, Nay, ſhould I not rejoyce to publiſh that love, eſpecially in ſo comfortable a manner, as in Communion with Chriſt, and his Saints on earth; and contribute my mite to keep its memory freſh and fragrant in the world: It's great ingratitude to have no longings for this Ordinance; yet it appears, that if ſome were placed in ſuch circumſtances, as no occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on offered, it would be no great grief of heart to them: or if occaſion offer, but it may be at ſome diſtance, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioning bodily trouble in attending, they can eaſily fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go it; though perhaps performing longer journeys at the ſame time to other places: or if opportunity offer in the place of their reſidence, yet it cometh undeſired; and a very triffle ſhal detain ſome from partaking; and all this, becauſe there is no love and deſire of ſoul after it: I ſpeak not this of all, but it's ſhameful to be found in any profeſſing Chriſtian, and ſo much the more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our bleſſed Redeemer teſtified ſo great regard to

Shal our Saviour teſtifie ſo great deſire for our good, and we have no deſire to receive it? Shal we ſo undervalue that Love, which can neither be overvalued, nor duely valued? <hi>Luke 22. 15.

And that thou ſhalt be preſerved unto that heavenly Kingdom: Is not thy poor ſoul many times ready to faint, by reaſon of thy Doubts, that thou has no intereſt in Gods ſpecial Favour, that thou never received the mercies of his Choſen, that though thou haſt received many mercies, yet thou knoweſt not but an Hypocrite may have all that ſort of mercies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred on thee?

<pb n="100" facs="tcp:65303:60"/> having a Pledge of his love, the mercy of being admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto ſuch near communion with him: thus a word may be bleſſed for engaging others in that Duty, which may be their bleſſing for ever. Whereas on the other hand, if thy mouth be filled with complaints, and others hear thee ſaying thou haſt no great benefit by Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, thou queſtions whether thou wilt go to the Lords Table or not, eſpecially if thou be a perſon noted for Religion; theſe who hear ſuch Diſcourſe being weak, will be tempted to think, what a fool am I to take in any thoughts of communicating, when ſuch an eminent Chriſtian ſpeaketh ſo meanly of it, as if little or no profit were to be had, I will give it over: and thus ſome poor tender ſmoaking Flax, may be quenched by your means; and if compaſſionate Ieſus be tender of them, (as no doubt he will) yet no thanks to you, who are guilty by caſting water on their little coal, which could have quench't it, if a better friend had not kept it in life.</p>
            <p>It may not be amiſs to conſider in this place, what may be the reaſons that ſo few profeſſing Chriſtians go to the Lords Supper with this neceſſary believing expectation: ſeing its diſhonourable to our bleſſed Redeemer obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth our own good, and is often found prejudicial to others.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ</hi> Firſt, It will be found that the ſeeds of Atheiſm, and unbelief of Gods Word and Promiſe, hath a deep hand in this wo. Ah! few Chriſtians by profeſſion are eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the truth; men do not &amp; will not lay this to heart, tho' they often hear it, and I fear are diſguſted, becauſe they ſo often hear it: proud Nature taking it heavily to be charged with unfixedneſs in the Faith; and theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reliſhing ſuch warnings moſt, who have moſt need of them. I wiſh the Reader concerned in this, retire to his own Conſcience and put the queſtion cloſly home: do I firmly believe the hiſtory of Chriſts Paſſion? And that Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is by no other Name? I ſpeak not now of mens perſwaſion, that Chriſt hath loved them, and waſhed them in his own Blood; but mens perſwaſion that he was dead, and is alive.

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:65303:60"/> know your misbelief by experience, to your grief in an hour of temptation, or at the hour of death: try there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in time what ye believe, and on what grounds; ſeek to be fixed in the faith of Chriſt and his truth, otherways your expectations will ſtill be faint. Nor do I ſpeak here of ſuch perſwaſion and fixedneſs in the truth, as is inconſiſtent with any degree of doubting: for here we know but in part, but that which I ſpeak is againſt that dangerous unfixedneſs, that hath no degree of perſwaſion, under which too many are periſhing.</p>
            <p>Secondly. But ſome others are not ſo much diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by misbelief of this nature, as by their fears that Chriſt will have no regard to them, that he will never honour them with ſuch communion with himſelf: others they grant may have it, but for themſelves, they look for nothing but a dry Fleece, when others are wet, they have deſerved no better, and expect no better.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> If our mercies be diſpenſed according to deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, then we may all ſtop together, and proceed no further. But bleſſed be God, that our expectations de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on free gree grace, I will freely love them. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14. 4. 2. Hath he not regarded thee already, in open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thine eyes to ſee thy wretchedneſs, which thou didſt not ſee before? Doth he not diſcover Diſeaſes in order to a remedy? If he had no regard to thee, he could have ſuffered thee to run on in preſumption, and ſit down at his Table, without ever minding a wedding Garment, and made thy riſing thy terrour; but now he preventeth it, by making thee conſider what thou art about. Therefore 3. If thou would be regarded at his Table and accepted, know, that a garment of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation will cover all thy ſpots: give praiſe that this Garment is ready for the putting on, give praiſe that its not only provided for the putting it on, but himſelf put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it on: Iſa. 61 10. <hi>He hath clothed me with the garments of ſalvation.</hi> Give praiſe that ever any poor ſinners were ſecured of theſe garments, and render praiſe that there is a minut of time left thee to beg theſe garments, that fine Linnen of the Saints, under which covering thou canſt not be deſpiſed, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> thy holy Expectation diſappointed.</p>
            <pb n="102" facs="tcp:65303:61"/>
            <p>Thirdly. Others faint in their expectations; becauſe tho' they have been often at the Lords Table, yet they never get great profit. <hi>Anſ.</hi> and whoſe fault was this? If thy misbelief deprived the of the communications of grace, where wilt thou leave thy complaint? For he warned thee, that mighty works were not to be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed where unbelief had the dominion; thou mayeſt go to a hundred Communions and never be the better, if thou doſt not believe nor draw out of the Wells of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: therefore if thou haſt a ſincere value for Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Chriſt, if thou would not always carry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way a bad report of that enriching Ordinance, if thou would'ſt prevent a contempt of it in thy own ſoul: conſider ſeriouſly what hath been thy manner of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating formerly; ſee thy way wherein thy particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar defects have been; thy neglect of preparation, thy hypocriſie; thy lukewarmneſs in the whole of the work; and thy misbelief at the work: repent of theſe evils, that thou mayeſt not ſay thou had a hard Maſter, but an hard heart.</p>
            <p>Fourthly. Others are diſcouraged in their expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, becauſe they obſerve not others who frequent Communions, much bettered in their converſations.</p>
            <p>This I grant is for a lamentation, that ſo few appear like communion with Chriſt: yet it is not ſo with all, and tho' they were but few, as <hi>Iſa. 17. 6. a few berries in the utmoſt fruitful branches.</hi> Its Gods great mercy, when ſome are preſerved as Witneſſes againſt a declin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing generation, who not only are made ſuitable to a publick ſolemn Communion; but ſuch as rarely, any thing can be diſcovered in their practice, that is not conſiſtent with preſent fellowſhip with God, tho' poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly ye diſcern it not, as being ignorant of walking with God your ſelves. 2. If this be thy regrate, that that thou ſeeſt ſo few fruitful Chriſtians after Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, then labour to add one to the number of theſe few, leſt others be diſcouraged by thy practice alſo. Thirdly. However it be as to partakers, tho many prove very unfruitful; yet this is never occaſioned by want of proviſion, being allowed to eat and drind abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:65303:61"/> and the hungry are filled with good things; and many have found their ſouls made as a watered Garden in attending this holy Ordinance. O that we were ſtirring up our ſelves, and ſtirring up one another, to pray down ſuch ſhowers of Bleſſings, as hath been found at Communions in the days of old.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>Objections of doubting Chriſtians anſwered.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>
               <label>The eighth Inference.</label>
            </p>
            <p>THe eighth Inference from the words, is, That ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo great a benefit as the Communion of Chriſts Body and Blood, may be had in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper: then Chriſtians are obliged to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour the removal of all Objections, and ſtumbling Blocks, that ſtand in the way to obſtruct their parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of this Benefit.</p>
            <p>Before the particular Objections be mentioned, I ſhall premit theſe few things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt.</hi> That all profeſſed Chriſtians ſhould make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, not to pretend Scruples and Objections where there is none; for where the Conſcience is not really burdened with ſome difficulty, its but hypocriſie to frame Objections againſt peoples partaking of the Lords Supper, that they may appear more ſerious than others: the heart of man is ſo deſperatly wicked and deceitful, that ſome have need of this Caution.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly.</hi> Yet on the other hand, when ſome are exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to prepare for the Lords Supper, eſpecially young people who did never partake before: if fears and doubts ariſe in their hearts, whereby they ſtand in need of counſel and help of the more experienced; they ſhould not deprive themſelves of that help, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they may be thought Hypocrites, or get a name of more ſeriouſneſs than they deſerve: as ſome have kept up their doubts from all others, until their doubts were
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:65303:62"/> too ſtrong for them, and brough them under ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, that it had been much their advantage to have revealed them ſooner.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3dly.</hi> Where ſtumbling Blocks are ſuch as may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved with a little pains, or ſome more humility; all ſhould make conſcience of getting them removed: As fore Inſtance, if there be variance betwixt perſons, where a little true humility would cure all, in confeſſing of wrongs and injuries done to others, or forgiving in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries: then men ſhould go to the utmoſt againſt their own pride, and ſubmit to one another, rather than to deprive themſelves of ſo bleſſed a communion with Chriſt. Eph. 5. 21. <hi>Submitting your ſelves one to another, in the fear of God</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>4thly.</hi> Where Objections are really ſerious and of weight, yet Chriſtians ſhould take care not to indulge them by heaping up of Scruples, and in the mean time, ſhutting their ears againſt any ſolution or mean of cle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ring their Doubt; they ſhould not conclude, that ſuch Objections cannot be anſwered, and ſo determine to follow their own Opinion, before means be uſed. As for Inſtance, ſome becauſe they find ſuch a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar evil in themſelves, or becauſe they have no perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that Chriſt will countenance them in that Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; do inconſideratly conclude they will not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take: but ſuch ſhould uſe all means within their reach, to know if theſe or the like Objections, be ſufficient argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to keep them from the duty of communicating.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>5thly.</hi> When ſome are obſerved to withdraw from the Lords Table, if they be of ſober and Chriſtian Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation; its uncharitable to judge them Hypocrites on that account, and to load them with Reproaches, as if they were all diſtempered, if they be not Hypocrites; for ye are diſcharged to judge. Mat. 7. 1. <hi>Judge not, that ye be not judged.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>6thly.</hi> Such as are of that Opinion, that all profeſſing Chriſtians ſhould without debate be Communicants, ſhould conſider, that all Communicants are required to examine themſelves, and accordingly act: and the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination required, is in order to partaking, that he
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:65303:62"/> who examineth, may find clearneſs in his Conſcience to partake: and without this, no man ſhould approach the Lords Table; that is, no man ſhould partake, who in the mean time doubteth, whether he ſhould partake or not, <hi>for whatſoever is not of faith, is ſin.</hi> Rom. 14. 23. I grant a Chriſtian may partake, tho' he hath may other doubts; but he cannot ſafely partake while this doubt remaineth: therefore all means ſhould be uſed, to have his conſcience convinced, that its his duty to partake: It cannot be ſufficient for a Chriſtian, to ſay I am not clear to communicat, and ſo continue neglecting that Ordinance, if he make not conſcience of getting ſtumbling Blocks in his way removed; the man is guilty of his own bondage, who doth not what he juſtly may, to get his Fetters off.</p>
            <p>And for your help I ſhall conſider, and by the Lords help anſwer ſome of theſe Objections, which I have moſt inſiſted on and urged. As,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt.</hi> Some object, I am not a Believer, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhould not go to the Lords Table.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Some object this indeliberatly; is it eaſie to think thy ſelf no Believer? Doſt thou conſider what will be the eternal lot of Unbelievers? ſure this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortleſs Concluſion ſhould have very evident reaſons. But its to be lamented, that ſome will very lightly object their not believing, when it may ſerve a turn, and keep them from a Duty they have no mind to, and yet little exerciſed, or grieved for the matter. You are eaſily ſatisfied not to go to the Lords Table, but will not take pains conſcientiouſlly to examine your faith, putting it to the tryal of Gods word; but thou thinkeſt thou art no Believer, and there's an end, and thus thou mayeſt ſinfully neglect that Ordinance while thou liveſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly.</hi> Before thou doſt impartially examine thy ſelf, thou art not ſure but the grace of Faith is given thee; and if it be given, thou art moſt ungrate to deny it: for a conſcientious Chriſtian doubting of his Faith, dare not therefore peremptorily ſay he hath no Faith, leſt he be injurious to the free Grace of God, not knowing but after ſerious examination, he may be enabled to
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:65303:63"/> ſay, <hi>I know in whom I have believed.</hi> 2 Tim. 1 12. He finds it very uneaſie, to charge himſelf with a graceleſs ſtate, except the grounds were undenyable; therefore ſearch well, before you fix ſo comfortleſs a Concluſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3dly.</hi> Weak Faith ſhould not be lookt on as no Faith; for Faith admitteth of degrees, ſome are of little Faith. Mat. 6. 30. <hi>O ye of little faith.</hi> Some are of great Faith. Mat. 15. 28. <hi>Woman, great is thy faith.</hi> And if you be of the very meaneſt, who have obtained like precious Faith, acknowledge it to the glory of the Giver: ſee that your Faith be of that kind, which uniteth Chriſt and the ſinner. Eph. 3. 17. <hi>Thy' ye cannot ſay that ye are ſtrong in faith, yet if you have received Chriſt, ye have a right to the childrens food.</hi> Gal. 3. 26. <hi>By faith we are the children of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>4thly.</hi> See that you miſtake not the nature of ſaving Faith, as if it were only a perſwaſion that you ſhall be ſaved; which is to follow after believing: if you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny, but the deſire of your ſoul is toward him; then you have ground of comfort: for the people of God have comforted themſelves with this deſire. Iſa. 26. 8. 9. <hi>The deſire of our ſoul is to thy Name, with my ſoul have I deſired thee.</hi> If God hath wrought this in you, do not deny the thing you find: What pleaſure have ye to deny God his due glory, and keep your ſouls in perplexity? Ye ſee the Children of God, have ſearched out their very deſires, and avowed them thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully before the ſearcher of hearts, which is alſo your duty; and if you cannot deny ſome real willingneſs to have Chriſt as he offereth himſelf, then a day of gracious power hath come to thy ſoul, for nothing could make thy heart willing but divine power, Pſal. 110. 3. <hi>Thy people ſhall be willing in the day of thy power.</hi> God hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed more on thee than only light, this is the Light of life, therefore ſearch it carefully if thy ſoul be made willing, and if thereby thou haſt been opening thy heart for Chriſt: for where the heart is opened by willingneſs, Chriſt hath certainly performed his word, Rev. 3. 20. <hi>He cometh in and ſuppeth with ſuch.</hi> There is no willing opened heart for Chriſt, but he is in that heart: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:65303:63"/> I would ſay, deſpiſe not the day of ſmall things, but that I dare not call any real deſire or willingneſs for Chriſt ſmall things; they are ſo enriching to every ſoul that hath them: the willing heart gets the <hi>water of life.</hi> Rev. 22. 17. and therefore a willing heart is a believing heart. Try alſo if thou findeſt thy ſoul lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on Chriſt; that notwithſtanding of all thy fears and doubts, yet thou ſtill hangeſt upon him, thou canſt not be rent from him, its as death to think on ſeparation from him: if thou thus depend and lean upon him, then he is the beloved of thy ſoul. Cant. 8. 5. <hi>The ſpouſe leaneth on her beloved.</hi> Tho' thy condition be as a Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, becauſe of griefs and fears; yet thou chooſeſt him for thy alone. Stay, thou ſeekeſt reſt to thy poor ſoul in none other but in him: then according to Pſal. 2. 12. <hi>Bleſſed are all that ſtay on him, or truſt in him.</hi> Thou comeſt to him for reſt, neither able to bear thy ſelf, nor thy burden; he will be as good as his word, Mat. 11. 28. <hi>I will give you rest.</hi> And thy coming, is thy Faith. <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 37.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> I cannot come to the Lords Table, for I have no hope to be accepted of him, how can I expect to meet with Chriſt there, who for any thing I know, did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver meet with him? How can I think to be accepted at his Table, for I do not find that ever he accepted of me?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> This Objection is of weight, but ſavoury. For <hi>1ſt,</hi> it reliſheth a diſcerning of the true intent of that Ordinance, which is a bleſſed meeting with Chriſt. <hi>2dly.</hi> Some remarking of Chriſts abſence. <hi>3dly.</hi> Some deſire for that Meeting and Communion. And <hi>4thly.</hi> A re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining grief in the ſoul for his withdrawing, and fear that they are not accepted: but to your Objection more particularly.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Take care you be not miſtaken as to your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance, for by reaſon of our weakneſs, its not eaſily diſcerned; you may be accepted of God, and not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted, and you may be comforted, and not accepted; Chriſt may be near, and doing you good to a high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and yet your ſelf not knowing he was near you,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:65303:64"/> Gen. 28 16. <hi>Surely the Lord is in this place, and I knew it not:</hi> and on the other hand, you may have delight in approaching to God, that is in the externals of duty, and yet be but proud hypocrites: as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58. 2. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore take heed how ye judge of acceptance, for too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and theſe not of the very worſt, advance their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in prayer as a rule, thereby to judge of their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance with God, if they have freedom to ſpeak, and ſome joy attending their ſpeaking, though they know not whence that joy ariſeth: for all may be meer nature or common gifts, for any thing they know, yet thereby conclude, God hath ſurely accepted of them, becauſe at ſuch a time, they had a great meaſure of joy and delight; but this Concluſion is not ſafe, except they can inſtruct and make it out, that it is the joy of the Lord, ſpiritual ſtrengthenin joy.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Conſider that you may be accepted of God, and anſwered in ſuch things as are moſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for you; tho' you be not anſwered in the manner ye would, if thy anſwer ſhould be as <hi>Pauls,</hi> 2 Cor. 12. 9. <hi>My grace is ſufficient for thee,</hi> thou art mercifully accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and anſwered; tho' the Thorn in the fleſh be not preſently pluckt out, ye may ſmart yet longer by its pain, and the grace ſuſtaining you is your anſwer and pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>f of your Acceptance.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Your perſons may be accepted, when ſome of your requeſts are not accepted: a <hi>Moſes</hi> accepted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to extra ordinary nearneſs and intimacy with God, yet ſome of his requeſts are not accepted, ſo as to be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Deut. 3. 25. <hi>I pray thee let me go over and ſee the good land that is beyond Jordan;</hi> but verſ. 26. <hi>let it ſuffice thee, ſpeak no more of this matter.</hi> Many Chriſtians are too ready to conclude, that God hath no regard to them; becauſe he granteth not what their hearts is ſet upon, whereas he is about to give them better things: <hi>Canaan</hi> was a pleaſant land, but a meer triflle to that heavenly <hi>Canaan</hi> beſtowed on <hi>Moſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, And ſuppoſing your requeſts were ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and neceſſary, for your ſouls good; yet ye are to wait for his anſwer: yea, tho' it tarry, wait for it: Hab. 2. 1. <hi>I</hi>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:65303:64"/> 
               <hi>will watch to ſee what he will ſay:</hi> thou thinkeſt there's no delay, thou art in a horrible Pit, yet remember Pſ. 40 1. 2. <hi>He brought me out of a horrible pit:</hi> after he had pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently waited for him, a Song of Deliverance will at length clear all, that your ſelves were accepted, and your neceſſary Petition recorded.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Yea its ſafer for you to queſtion the truth of your coming unto God, and the ſincerity of your prayers; than the truth of his accepting ſuch as come unto him, He having ſaid he will in no ways caſt out, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 37. It's too common, tho' a dangerous evil, to charge God with our own faults, and to complain of him for refuſing, when we either ask not, or ask amiſs: who dare ſay that they ſeek and ſearch for God with their whole heart? But he is found of them. <hi>Jer.</hi> 29. 12. Who are put away that bring their hearts unto God? <hi>If thou doſt well, ſhalt thou not he accepted?</hi> Gen. 4. 7. Yet proud Nature, will ſtill blame God rather than it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Conſider well on what account ye can be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of God, that it's only in the beloved Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 6. Proud Nature hurteth us here alſo, prompting us to think, we may be accepted for our own ſincerity, or fervency; <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And ſo, acceptance with God is not ſought in Chriſts Name; and if not ſought in his Name, by what warrant can we expect it? <hi>Joh. 14. 14. If ye ſhall ask any thing in my name, I will do it:</hi> its not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent that mens judgements are ſatisfied it ſhould be ſo; for many are not ignorant of this, who yet do not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it; therefore as ye deſire acceptance with God at any time, and eſpecially at the Lords Table, labour, <hi>1ſt.</hi> To be found in Chriſt. <hi>2dly.</hi> Let all your Prayers be actually, and as diſtinctly in his Name as ye can reach. <hi>3dly.</hi> Obſerve well what anſwer ye get, eſpecially when your ſouls are bettered and ſtrengthened in holineſs af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter prayer, that ye may no more complain that ye have no acceptance with God, but enabled to ſay, as Pſal. 66. 19 <hi>But verily God hath heard me, he hath attended to the voice of my prayer;</hi> and then bleſs him as in the next Verſ. <hi>That he hath neither turned away thy prayer, nor his</hi>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:65303:65"/> 
               <hi>grace from thee. 4thly</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd finding that the Lord hath mercifully accepted of you, and your prayers, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways than ye thought, then be encouraged in the Lord, and ſay, as Pſal. 116. 1. <hi>I love the Lord, becauſe he hath beard my voice and my ſupplications:</hi> and Verſ. 13. <hi>I will take the cup of ſalvation, and call upon the Name of the Lord.</hi> And therefore <hi>5thly.</hi> When thou art at his Table, ſet thy ſoul for accepting of Chriſt, and be not jealous of his Offer, for thou ſhalt have a bleſſed Meeting. I may ſay of this Ordinance, as is expreſſed by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, pointing at Goſpel Ordinances in the latter days, Ezek. 20. 40. <hi>This is the mountain of the heigth of Iſrael, and there will I accept thee:</hi> here is a Mercy-ſeat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, Chriſt revealed, as dying to obtain mercy for poor ſinners, and on this Mercy-ſeat he meeteth with his people. <hi>Exod.</hi> 25. 22.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> I cannot go to the Lords Table, for I know that I ſhall not live ſuitable to Engagements made there, I find it already to my grief, that all my former Vows are broken; I will break no moe engagements of that nature, better keep my ſelf free of that addition to my former ſins, and pray that the Lord would par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don me for my unfaithfulneſs in times paſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Its to be ſuppoſed in charity, that you do not deſign to be unfaithful, if ye ſhould communicat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, for ye appear to grieve for it; but for you to propheſie that it will be ſo hereafter, is a limiting of the power and mercy of God? What do you know what is to come? For you may have that at one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, which you never obtained before. <hi>Is the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Lord ſtraitned,</hi> that ye cannot be made faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful? <hi>Micah.</hi> 2. 7.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly.</hi> It appears to have been your cuſtom, to truſt your ſelves with keeping of your Vows, for ye dare not truſt God with it; you think it dangerous to put your ſelves ſo far in his reverence, as that either you muſt truſt him, or be treacherous, and therefore you will not expoſe your ſelves to that neceſſity of his help: Ah poor ſoul! wilt thou not be beholden to God for holding up thy goings? Pſal. 17. 5. <hi>Hold up my goings.</hi> Wilt thou not be beholden to him, for cauſing thee walk in his ways, and making thee faithful? <hi>Ezek.</hi> 39

            <p>
               <hi>3dly</hi> If thou be a Chriſtian indeed, and concerned in Chriſt, then thou art commanded to do this in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of him. Now what ſort of a Chriſtian art thou, who dare ſay to him in his face, Lord, thou ſayeſt do this? But I ſay, I will not do this; for thy Objection runs ſo, I reſolve I will not communicat more; and giveſt thy reaſon, becauſe I will not come under ſuch Engagements as I am ready to break; and becauſe thou canſt never communicat but thou wilt come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch Engagements, its all one, as if thou had ſaid, I will never communicat. Chriſt ſaith, <hi>his yoke is eaſie,</hi> Mat. 11. 30. Thou ſayeſt it is ſo uneaſie, I will never put my neck more under it. Canſt thou hold up thy face and tell him ſo? Remember who ſaid Pſal. 2. 3. <hi>Let us break their bands aſunder, and caſt away their cords from us.</hi> Here is the Myſtery; pretend what ye will, that the Bonds of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty are troubleſome, and therefore theſe Cords muſt be caſt away, and then we ſhall have ſome more liberty to do as we liſt: and thus thou makeſt a ſnare for thy own poor ſoul, thou lookeſt on thy Duty as a ſnare to thee, but now thou art caught in a ſnare of thy own making, to ſin with eaſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>4thly.</hi> Thou appears to think it unlawful to come under ſuch a Bond, as if we ſhould not make ſuch En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements; How then ſayeſt thou to that? <hi>Pſal. 76. 11. Vow unto the Lord your God and pay:</hi> there the Lord maketh it a Duty, which thou refuſeſt as evil. Pſal. 119. 105. <hi>I have ſworn and will perform it, that I will keep thy righteous judgements.</hi> It was never the way of Godly men, to ſay I will engage no more to God, but their way hath been, to reſolve on paying of their Vows to God. Pſal. 61. 8. <hi>That I may dayly perform my vows.</hi> And Pſal. 56. 12. <hi>Thy vows are upon me O God, I will render praiſes unto thee.</hi> And therefore,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>5thly.</hi> Thy beſt way is to lament and mourn for thy unfaithfulneſs, and yet reſolve upon paying of thy Vows, bleſſing God that there is yet a Seaſon for repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance:
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:65303:66"/> and if thou repents indeed, there will be a care for the time to come, that no Duty be neglected; thou wilt be afraid to neglect communicating, but labour to prepare for it; becauſe Chriſt hath made it a Duty, thou wilt not think that any ſinful omiſſion can cure thy former evils.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>6thly.</hi> Whereas thou ſayeſt, that thou wilt ſeek for the remiſſion of thy former failings which thou hopeſt to obtain, tho' thou never go to the Lords Table. I anſwer, if thou obtaineſt pardon, it muſt be by the Blood of Chriſt, which cleanſeth from all ſin. 1 Joh. 1. 7. <hi>The blood of Jeſus Chriſt his ſon, cleanſeth us from all ſin.</hi> Now in the Lords Supper, there is an offer of the benefit of this precious Blood: and if thou delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratly refuſeſt the application of Chriſts Blood, in the way that he hath appointed, its juſt that thou ſhould never get that precious Blood applyed in thy way, ſince thou knowingly refuſeſt his way: for albeit the pardon of ſin doth not abſolutely depend on participation of that holy Ordinance, but that he who believeth, eateth Chriſts fleſh and drinketh his blood, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 54. And a Godly perſon may be in ſuch Circumſtances, as he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have the benefit of the Lords Supper; yet the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of Chriſts Inſtitution where this Ordinance is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred, is a ſin of an high nature; as if Chriſt had inſtituted it in vain: and therefore I ſay its juſt with God, to deprive thee of pardon in thy way, while thou deſpiſeſt his way.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>7thly.</hi> No Chriſtian who obſerveth his own way, but will find cauſe of mourning, for being unſuitable to ſuch holy Priviledges and Engagements: will it therefore follow, that no Chriſtian who hath failed in his Duty, ſhall again partake? Then the beſt of men might reſolve on no more communicating, and Chriſt ſhall not have the publick honour due to him by it. But if you ſay, your unfaithfulneſs hath been very grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous and extraordinary? ſtill anſwer, you have the more need of the vertue of Chriſts Blood for remiſſion, which ſhould be applyed in that ſpecial manner he hath requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; and therefore thy Duty is to repent, and prepare
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:65303:66"/> to ſhew forth the glory of Chriſts love manifeſted in that holy Ordinance; and the greater thy tranſgreſſions be, the greater is thy debt to ſhew forth his Death: by which Death, only thou can be preſerved from that ſecond Death which thou haſt deſerved.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> I cannot go to the Lords Table for he hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken me, he hath caſt off my ſoul, he ſendeth nothing for my good, and nothing doth me good, he hath left me to my own counſels; why then ſhould I profane ſo holy an Ordinance?</p>

               <hi>5ly,</hi> It's neceſſary alſo prudently to conceal what Temptations they diſcover, for if they find them publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, they will be ready to impart no more; and withal if their moſt frighting Temptations be publiſhed, the very ſhame of them may heighten their anguiſh, and tempt to worſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>6ly,</hi> It's expedient alſo, their friends take care, that they be not troubled with ſuch company, as may increaſe their affliction, ſuch as are not prudent, but may be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to quarrel them for ſome of their expreſſions, or poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly mock them, which will be to their grief: as alſo from ſuch company as are in like caſe with themelves, and not yet healed of their wounds: but theſe who have been in ſuch trouble, and are now at liberty from their former bondage, are moſt meet for converſe with them, to declare what God hath done for their ſouls, <hi>Pſal:</hi> 66: 16.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>7ly,</hi> Great prudence and caution is neceſſary to any friend of theirs, who would perſwade them to go to the Lords Table while under the violence of theſe Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: for to urge them without ſome compoſure of mind, and freedom in their own conſciences, may have bad effects: the ſafeſt way is to uſe arguments for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing them of their Duty, and if this cannot be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, better forbear until God make light to ariſe, and they be more fitted for it: I have known ſome who being preſſed by their friends, have been perſwaded to go to the Lords Table, but being there did not open their mouth either to eat or drink, which afterward raiſed their trouble to a great height, and are at this day under deep diſtreſs on that account: it appears then to conduce more for the good of ſuch ſouls, to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them to wait for a more ſerene hour by the ariſing of the Sun of Righteouſneſs, whereby the dark clouds ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding them, ſhall be diſpelled, and then in his light they ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And for ſuch as are tempted, all of you are not in a
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:65303:70"/> like danger; and faithfulneſs requires to be plain with ſuch of you as have never been concerned for your ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, that your danger is great every way until ye flee to Chriſt as your refuge: and though ye hear that godly perſons has been aſſaulted with horrid Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, yet that is no ground for you to think your ſelves godly, becauſe ye have ſuch Temptations, for ye may have their Temptations, but want ſuch grace to reſiſt them; if ye embrace not Chriſt and Salvation through him, ye expoſe your ſelves as a prey to any Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; having no intereſt in him who came to deſtroy the works of the Devil: Therefore cry to God to make you ſerious for Salvation, to make you ſincere Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and convert you to himſelf by his ſpirit of grace; and the more ye are tempted, be the more diligent, make the greater haſte, that ye may be found in Chriſt, by whom ye ſhal be overcomers: and who knoweth, but meat may come out of the eater, and he who goeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout as a roaring lion ſeeking to devour, be diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of his deſign, and thy affliction under theſe very temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations be made by the over-ruling power of God, a mean to make thee flee to Chriſt for Salvation to thy ſoul, and deliverance from all thine Enemies, and if you will fix on this way for your relief, and all of you who have done ſo before ye came under theſe fiery trials, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That bleſſed Jeſus Chriſt was tempted himſelf, and tempted to the greateſt ſins, even to worſhip the Devil, God's great enemy, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. 9. And to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy himſelf by being guilty of his own Death, ver. 6. By caſting himſelf down from the Pinacle of the Temple All this and more he ſubjected unto, and being carried by Satan from one place to another, that thou a poor weak tempted Believer might be perſwaded, he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the greateſt and worſt of thy Temptations, <hi>2ly,</hi> That he will have Sympathy with thee as being tempted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>Heb. 2: 18. 3ly,</hi> That he hath ſanctified this trial to Believers, by ſubjecting to it himſelf; for though the wicked Temptations be not ſanctified, yet thy lot under them is thereby ſanctified. <hi>4ly,</hi> That he overcoming
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:65303:71"/> them all, thou in him as thy head, ſhalt alſo overcome: Therefore adhere ſtill to him, and thou cannot ſink, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12: 11. He who accuſeth day and night is overcome <hi>by the blood of the lamb.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly,</hi> Conſider, That there are ſome Temptations that are the Devils ſins, rather than ours, not ariſing from our ſelves, nor entertained by us, are but the fiery Darts of Satan caſt in by violence: if Satan ſhould now appear or any other way ſhould tempt a godly man, to renounce God and worſhip him, this godly man at the very firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting ſuch Temptation with Indignation and hatred, is not guilty by that Temptation, albeit the nature of the Temptation be moſt horrid and blaſphemous; and albeit the ſame godly man have ſin remaining in him, yet that temptation is not his ſin; becauſe it neither had it's Original in his heart, nor in any meaſure entertained by him: therefore do not ſo far yield to the Adverſary, as to take with all his Temptations, as if they were your ſins, for that's no final part of his deſign, thereby to ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify you, as if ye were the moſt monſtrous ſinners in the World: the Apoſtle <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 17. Finding a gracious principle in his ſoul againſt Sin, and Sin making war a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the law of his mind, he can ſay of this Enemy that warreth againſt him, this Enemy is not himſelf, it's no more I but ſin that dwelleth in me: the tempted Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er may well ſay, it's not I, but Satan who tempteth me; and ſo much the more, becauſe theſe Temptations had never that place in his heart that his Sins have: albeit it be afflicting to a child of God, that Satan ſhould come ſo near, yet he is in all this but at War, not gaining nor yielded unto.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3ly,</hi> Therefore be ſure of your reſiſting theſe Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from firſt to laſt, for voluntary entertaining ſuch Suggeſtions would ſoon weaken your confidence, and ſtrengthen your adverſary; therefore let all your thoughts be reſiſting thoughts, and then the Temptation, and thou are ſtill Antagoniſts oppoſite one to another, when thou art reſiſting, thou art ſtill in Gods way for a victory, <hi>Jam. 4. 7. Reſiſt the Devil and he will flee from you.</hi> And what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ye do, be careful to keep on Gods ground, keep by
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:65303:71"/> your poſt where God hath placed you, yielding nothing, <hi>and having done all, to ſtand.</hi> Eph. 6. 13.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>4ly,</hi> Conſider alſo, That we are not alone in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict, <hi>Eph. 6. 12. For we wreſtle not againſt fleſh and blood, but againſt principalities, againſt powers, againſt the rulers of the darkneſs of this world.</hi> And though all Believers have not a like violent Temptations, yet all of them have Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans Temptations to wreſtle againſt, nor do ye know the Temptations of many others, though your own ſmarts you moſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>5ly,</hi> Whatever be your Temptations, know that God hath not left you deſtitute of Armour againſt them, <hi>Eph. 6. 11. Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to ſtand againſt the wiles of the Devil.</hi> The very believing of this in thy heart, that God hath provided armour to preſerve his people from danger, will be an encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to thee; but if thou think there is no relief, them thou fainteſt, and thereby thy Adverſary hath advantage, a fainting man is ſoon overcome, but if thou think in thy heart there is relief at hand, then thou waxeſt valient in fight: and if the hope of this Armour be ſo ſtrengthening what will the putting of it on be; take counſel then who hath provided it, and put it on, for it was provided for ſuch as thee; and remark well what is ſaid, ver. 16. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all taking the ſhield of faith, wherewith ye ſhal be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.</hi> Chriſt's Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour will be proof, though the Darts be dipt in Hell, they ſhal not conſume thee, though thy trial be like a fiery Furnace, yet ſet thy ſelf to follow the footſteps of the Flock, who by Faith, <hi>Quenched the violence of fire,</hi> Heb. 11. 34. And when thou art at the loweſt, labour ſtill to retain the impreſſions of God's omnipotence, think no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing too hard for him, do not ſo diſhonour him, as to think thy caſe incurable, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32. 17. Is there any thing too hard for me.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>6ly,</hi> Give thy ſelf frequently to Prayer, and complain of the violence done to thy poor ſoul by thine Adverſary, hearken to no ſuggeſtion againſt Prayer, for thy God commandeth thee to call on him in the day of trouble, and he will deliver, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. 15. Thou wilt be tempted to
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:65303:72"/> think it's in vain to Pray: but believe not the father of lies, God hath not required to ſeek him in vain, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45. 19. He will tempt thee to think thou art not the better of Prayers, thou art not heard; but what if thou ſhould be for a ſhort ſeaſon, that thou couldeſt obſerve no anſwer of Prayer, remember that better than you, have complained of the ſame, <hi>Pſal. 22. 2. O my God I cry in the day time, but thou heareſt not, and in the night ſeaſon, and am not ſilent, but was it always ſo?</hi> No, Mark what is ſaid in the ſame <hi>Pſal.</hi> ver. 24. and 25. <hi>For he hath not deſpiſed nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted, neither hath he bid his face from him, but when he cried unto him he heard.</hi> And then follows a ſong of praiſe in the next ver. I know of ſome at this day under deep deſertion, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted with ſome of the worſt of Temptations, but their condition is hopeful on this very account, becauſe they expreſly ſay if God ſhould never hear me, it's my Duty to pray, and I will pray: let no depths hinder thee, but pray the rather, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130. 1. <hi>Out of the depths have I cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto thee O Lord.</hi> And ver. 4th It follows, <hi>But there is forgivenneſs with thee,</hi> and ver. 7th <hi>Let Iſrael hope in the Lord, for with the Lord there is mercy, and with him is plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terus redemption.</hi> It ſhould be obſerved, that where vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Temptations do moſt hurt, commonly theſe tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed perſons will not be perſwaded to pray, and ſuch as continue to pray, do ordinarly obtain a comfortable victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>7ly,</hi> Reſolve alſo to wait on thy God, for at his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the ſtorm is ſoon changed in to a calm, <hi>Weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning,</hi> Pſal. 30. 5. A fixed reſolution to wait on God, is both thy Duty, and will be a great advantage to thy ſoul, Remember Pſ. 40. 1. I <hi>waited patiently, and he brought me out of an horrible pit.</hi> Give not way to ſudden concluſions that thy hope is loſt, and thou art cut off, as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. 11. make no unwarrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able propheſies that it will never be better with thee, if thou but reſolve this on thing to wait, Satan ſhal be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed, whoſe great deſign is to have thee as deſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at as himſelf; ſtill leave place for the mercy and infinite power of God, <hi>Encline your ear, come yet unto the Lord, hear</hi>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:65303:72"/> 
               <hi>and your ſoul ſhal live,</hi> Iſa. 55. 3. Let God have a hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for ſhame, ſince Satans ſuggeſtions hath got ſo long hearing, God ſaith hearken to me, Satan ſaith hearken not to God, that thou mayeſt be another rebel to God as he is: but let thine Enemy know that thou haſt an open ear for thy God. I <hi>will hearken what God the Lord will ſpeak unto me, for he will ſpeak peace unto his people,</hi> Pſal. 85. 8. And if thou ſhalt ſay, Oh what can I hear? That will do good to me? No words can break Bars of Braſs and Iron, I am Bound and in a Priſon, yet nevertheleſs. ſtay until you hear who ſpeaketh, and what he ſpeaketh, Therefore Conſider,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>8ly,</hi> That if you will hearken, you ſhal hear of doing for you, which is more than Words, ye complain that ye are bound, and cannot ſhake off your Fetters; how then do ye like it to hear of one who is coming to open your Priſon, Iſa. 61. 1. <hi>The ſpirit of the Lord God is upon me, becauſe the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek, he hath ſent me to bind up the broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the priſon to them that are bound.</hi> Sure this is worth the hearing, that Chriſt hath it in commiſſion to open ſuch Priſons, and <hi>2ly,</hi> That he is able to perform his Commiſſion. For he openeth, and who can ſhut, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 7. and <hi>3ly,</hi> That his Name is Faithful who hath this work to do, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 11. Look up then O Priſoner of hope, for Satan endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours ſtill to have thee looking down, deſiring to have thee fall down at laſt where he is, he knoweth that long and ſtedfaſt looking into a frighting deep place, is apt to turn a man giddy, and thereby endangered to fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſame depth, ſo his great care is that thou never turn thine eye upward, knowing that to be thy relief: therefore be not befooled by him, but look up and be ſaved, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45. 22. Say as <hi>Pſal. 142. 7. Bring my ſoul out of priſon, that I may praiſe thy Name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>9ly,</hi> Mind alſo that thine Adverſary is ſtill in Chains, and cannot go beyond Divine permiſſion. <hi>They are in chains of darkneſs,</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 4. ſo alſo Jude ver. 6. <hi>They are reſerved in everlaſting chains under darkneſs, unto the judgment of the great day.</hi> And ſo we ſee nothing could
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:65303:73"/> be done by Satan againſt godly <hi>Job,</hi> but as Divine po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer ordered and over-ruled, Job 1. 12. <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto ſatan, behold all that he hath is in thy power, only upon himſelf put not forth thine hand,</hi> &amp; Chapter 2 ver. 6. <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto ſatan, behold he is in thine hand, but ſave his life.</hi> So thou art not at thy worſt, abſolutely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Dominion, he is never out of the Chain; thou art ſtill under the abſolute Dominion of thy God, not an hair ſhal fall from thy head in this conflict, without a Divine Providence; keep the impreſſion of this upon thy heart, for it is a grand deſign of the Tempter to have thee think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, thou art now wholly in his hand without remedy, he will tempt thee to think that God taketh no care of thee, hath no pity on thee, and never regardeth thee, that ſo he may draw thee either to ſome diſlike of God as merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, or to deny that there is any Providence of God, and ſo carry thee on if he can to doubt if there be any God but himſelf, if he can drive thee to this, then his helliſh deſign is far ripened, then he tempts thee to think thou muſt obey him, thou art wholly in his hand: I have heard ſome acknowledge this was their Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but when Satan did drive hardeſt, he made but fools haſte; for that Temptation became ſo frightning, that they were helped to hearken the leſs to any of his tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, and ſo the Devils malice over-run his policy; the Lord diſcovering the wickedneſs of his devices: for when poor tempted ſouls are at the very brink of ruine, &amp; knows not what to do but yield all to the Tempter, yet <hi>The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> 2 Pet. 2: 9.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>10ly,</hi> Know alſo, that though thy Temptations be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dreadful, yet while God helpeth thee to continue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting them as an hateful burden, under which thou groans, then thou ſtandeſt yet on God's ſide againſt his Enemy, thou fighteſt againſt theſe Temptations, as God's Enemies &amp; thine, then God will be for thee. I <hi>am for thee, Ezek.</hi> 36. 9, Faint not in his Service, he will not leave you alone, <hi>Hag. 2. 4. Be ſtrong, for I am with thee.</hi> He will not ſee thee periſh in his own cauſe fighting againſt his Enemies, he will ſend from above, and draw thee out of theſe
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:65303:73"/> depths, though thine Adverſary hath thruſt ſore at thee, that thou mighteſt fall, yet thou ſhal have it to ſay,, <hi>But the Lord helped me,</hi> Pſal. 118. 13. And though thou be ſore wounded in the time, yet he will tenderly bind up theſe wounds, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147. 3. Hold on the fight, and the Lord will teach thee to fight, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 144. 1. He teacheth my fingers to fight, and ye ſhal fight becauſe the Lord is with you, <hi>Zechariah</hi> 10. 5. Yielding is thy greateſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>11ly,</hi> Do not gratifie Temptations by allowing time to attend them, ſince thou art to pray that thou be not led into Temptation, then do not caſt thy ſelf into it by idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, neglecting the Duties of thy Calling, ſet about thy Work, whether thy Station lead thee to employment of the Mind or Body, thou haſt thy God and his ſervice to wait upon, and has no time allowed thee to attend his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies and their ſervice, if thou give the tempter time he will give thee Work, he will ſtrive to have thee ſo far engaged as to draw back from thy Duty to God and man, and attend what he hath to ſay; if thou yield to this he has too great Advantage: I know you are ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire from all company, and your ordinary Affairs, and ſay ye are not capable of buſineſs; but ſee that many of your retirements, be not rather to talk with the Tempter, than to talk with God; I acknowledge frequent Retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for Prayer are moſt neceſſary, but then take care that the time be not worſe ſpent, advert to this eſpecially in the beginning of thy Temptations, that thou enter not the conflict with preſent ſinning, by omitting of plain Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to God, relations or others.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>12ly,</hi> And that thou may'ſt have the benefit of Chriſt's coming to deſtroy the works of the Devil, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 8. And the comfortable hope that Satan who hath ſo bruiſed thee, ſhal be ſhortly trampled under thy feet, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 20. Eſſay yet once more to believe, and in believing thou ſhalt <hi>ſee the glory of God,</hi> Joh. 11. 40. When thou haſt toiled and outwearied thy ſelf ſeeking reſt, yet thou ſhalt find it no where, but in Chriſt who inviteth thee to come and get reſt to thy Soul, which he promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to give, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 29. Here muſt be the end and
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:65303:74"/> concluſion, If thou deſireſt and expecteſt to enter into reſt, for <hi>Heb. 4. 3. We which have believed do enter into rest.</hi> Labour then through the throng of all oppoſition &amp; difficulties to adventure on believing in Chriſt, as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf commandeth, <hi>Joh. 14. 1. Let not your hearts be troubl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ye believe in God, believe alſo in me.</hi> Here is the true cure for a troubled heart, adventure on Chriſt's counſel, keep ſtill by his Word, for it's the Sword of the Spirit.</p>
            <p>I know ſome who were almoſt cruſhed under violent and moſt dangerous Temptations; in ſo much that friends were dejected, both becauſe the Temptations were ſo ſtrong that they could hardly be concealed, and a reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very more and more hopleſs: but one day that perſon by the tender mercy of God begun to think; that ther's no mention in all the Scriptures of Chriſt's rejecting any poor Sinner coming to him for relief, whereupon forthwith that perſon reſolved to Eſſay believing in Chriſt, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhould follow; the Eſſay was no ſooner made, but inſtantly the God of mercy gave a comfortable victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry over all theſe Temptations, with encreaſe of Grace, and great joy attending the healing of theſe wounds; and yet continues of a Goſpel becoming converſation, free of all theſe afflicting Bonds: This I can atteſt for truth from the perſons own mouth the next day after God had bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken theſe Bars of Braſs, and Iron. And judge it Duty to publiſh it for the encouragement of poor tempted ſouls; that they may conſider how ſignally our gracious God doth countenance ſuch as in the very throng of Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, caſt themſelves and their burden upon the Lord.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> But may I take any comfort in the hope that theſe frighting Suggeſtions and Temptations are not ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally from my ſelf, it's grievous that they ſhould be in my thought at all, but much more, if I be the Author of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. It's certain that our ſelves are the Authors of many Temptations, Jam. 1. 14. <hi>But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own luſt, and enticed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly,</hi> It's alſo clear, that Satan who is called the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. 3. Doth work upon mens own corruptions and promoteth the wickedneſs of them, ſo that the luſts
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:65303:74"/> of wicked men are ſaid to be the luſts of the Devil, <hi>Joh 8. 44. And the luſts of your father ye will do.</hi> So he Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveth the prevalent Sins that men have the greateſt propenſion unto, as the covetouſneſs of <hi>Judas,</hi> and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes of mens paſſions, as grief to have them ſwallowed up with overmuch grief, 2 <hi>Cor. 2. 7. Lest perhaps ſuch a one ſhould be ſwallowed up with overmuch ſorrow,</hi> and ver. 11. <hi>Lest ſatan ſhould get an advantage of us, for we are not ignor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant of his devices.</hi> And melancholy ſouls darkened with their own Imaginations give great advantage, to the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of the darkneſs of this World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3ly,</hi> But Temptations do ſometimes ariſe only from Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, as to their firſt original, and therefore he is called the tempter, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. 3. Becauſe it's his work to tempt, and therefore tempted where there could be no hope of prevailing as appeared in his tempting of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>4ly,</hi> And becauſe of our depraved natures, we are in danger of infection by theſe Temptations, that hath their ſource and firſt riſe from Satan.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>5ly,</hi> All Temptations to Evil ſhould be reſiſted, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we know the firſt ſpring from whence theſe Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions flow or not, our work is to reject them whether they be our own, or mixt, with Satans Temptations, or his only.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>6ly,</hi> Some of theſe Temptations that are immediately from Satan, are called the fiery Darts of the wicked One, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 16. So that the Dart cometh from the Devil, and not from the mans heart, they are called fiery Darts, being ſuddenly thrown in for ſetting all on Fire in the Soul, whereby there is ſuch an unuſual diſturbance and ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing terrour, as if all were in a Flame, it being as death to them, finding ſuch ſuggeſtions againſt God, and their own Salvation, as they never found before, and theſe ſo rageing that they know not where or how to hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the fury of the Flame, theſe will be charged on Satans account, Conſidering,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That upon their very firſt appearing and aſſault, thou meeteſt them with hatred indignation and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly,</hi> Though they continue ſometime, yet they are no
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:65303:75"/> more welcome, than if Fireballs were thrown into thy Houſe to burn thee and it up together, thou giveſt no conſent to them.</p>
            <p>

            <p>
               <hi>4ly,</hi> Thou lookeſt up to God to deliver thee.</p>
            <p>

            <p>
               <hi>6ly,</hi> Thou art ſo far from cheriſhing of them, that their returning is thy great fear.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>7ly,</hi> And any wicked ſuggeſtion againſt the honour of God, is paining to thy ſoul.</p>
            <p>Theſe may help thee to underſtand, that ſuch helliſh blaſphemous Temptations are the Darts and Sins of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> Some ſay, they dare no more preſume to go to the Lords Table: becauſe when they did partake they are perſwaded that they did eat and drink unworthily ſo that it's not only an unſuitable deportment that they have to bemoan as to their practice afterward, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that when they did Receive, they did eat and drink Judgment to themſelves; and therefore wiſh they had never Received, I heard ſome ſay, that they thought their Communicating was the greateſt Sin they ever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in their Life-time; but then they were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed with other temptations, ſo that this was ſaid in an hour of Darkneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Who can ſay, that they eat of that Bread, and drink of that Cup ſo worthily, but that their failings are great in the very time of Receiving, for which if God would enter into Judgement they could not ſtand? What humble man dare ſay his apprehenſions of a cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Chriſt were ſo diſtinct as ought to have been? Or that his Faith and Love were acted to that degree requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? Shal therefore the beſt of men on Earth, conclude that they did eat and drink unworthily, and ſo are guilty of the Body and Blood of the Lord, and leave his Table always with Anguiſh, rather than rejoycing in God their Saviour, do you not ſee this a Temptation, tending to the utter rejection of that bleſſed Ordinance of Chriſt?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly,</hi> Some of you who make this Objection, cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:65303:75"/> but that you did make Conſcience of ſerious Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp; that you deſired with reverence &amp; love to Receive Chriſt himſelf, when you did receive the viſible Signs, only ye had not that meaſure of Faith and Love which you deſired, the worſt you have to charge your ſelf with was your weakneſs, not Contempt, nor was it Ignorance, as to the diſcerning of Chriſt's Body: but becauſe your graces were not ſo lively as they ought; I grant it's neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to bemoan our Failings, but this is not the place of our perfection, when that cometh, we ſhal not need to Partake in ſuch a manner as now, but while we are here, we muſt apply that precious Blood, for purging away the guilt we contract in our beſt actings, yea, in the very time of Communicating, we muſt apply Chriſt's Blood for the pardon of our Failings in Communicating; ſo that your better way were to go again to the Lords Table, and when you Receive, learn and practiſe that way of applying that precious Blood that cleanſeth from all Sin, to cleanſe you particularly from any ſin you are guilty of by your weakneſs in Communicating.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3ly,</hi> And know, that there is a neceſſity of diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing between Sins of Infirmity, and Sins allowed: The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was conſtrain'd to make uſe of this diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for his own comfort, when he ſaith <hi>Rom. 7. 15, For that which I do, I allow not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>4ly,</hi> But ſuppoſing it were as you Object, that you did once eat and drink unworthily, it doth not follow, that eternal Judgement ſhal be inevitable, albeit the Sin be repented of, for the clearing of this alittle, Conſider, <hi>Firſt,</hi> That it's granted, every ſin deſerveth Judgment, yea, eternal Judgment, and therefore, <hi>2ly,</hi> This Sin of unworthy Communicating deſerveth that Judgement. <hi>3ly,</hi> The Apoſtle by Judgement here doth not underſtand on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Eternal Judgement, for he ſpeaketh plainly of tempor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Judgments inflicted, for profanation of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, <hi>ver.</hi> 30. For this cauſe many are weak and Sickly among you, and many ſleep, therefore he underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not only Eternal Judgment. <hi>4ly,</hi> Some Partake of theſe temporal Judgments as chaſtenings, that they ſhould not be condemned with the World. <hi>ver,</hi> 32. Yet theſe
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:65303:76"/> chaſtenings are for their ſinful Communicating, then it followeth, that ſome who are ſinful in their manner of Communicating, yet many obtain pardon, the Lord chaſtening them for not Communicating aright, that they may not be condemned with the World; Though they deſerved Eternal Judgment by profaneing that holy Ordinance, yet by free grace they are forgiven, God in his tender mercy reſerving room for Repentance.</p>
            <p>Conſider alſo, that the Paſſeover was a Seal of the ſame Covenant of Grace, and great Sanctifying Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion required for its Celebration, for every Partaker was to be ſanctified unto the Lord, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30. 17. But ſome had not cleanſed themſelves, yet did they eat the Paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over otherwiſe than it was written, <hi>ver. 18. But Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah prayed for them,</hi> that the Lord would pardon ſuch as prepared their hearts to ſeek God, <hi>though he be not cleanſed according to the purification of the Sanctuary, ver. 19. And the Lord hearkned to Hezekiah, and healed the people.</hi> ver, 20, Whereby we may ſee that ſins of that Nature, are pardoned when ſincerely acknowledged, and applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made unto the tender mercies of God. The know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of this is neceſſary for ſome, who fear their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation is inevitable, becauſe of their not Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating aright; but by theſe Scriptures ye may ſee that all ſhall not be condemned who have been guilty by ſins of that nature, where Repentance is, there is remiſſion of ſins by Chriſt, giving both together, <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 31.</p>

            </argument>
            <p>
               <label>The 9th Inference.</label>
            </p>
            <p>THis Ordinance being the Communion of Chriſt's Body and Blood, then, after Partaking, Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicants are obliged to try if they have obtained that bleſſed Communion.</p>
            <pb n="133" facs="tcp:65303:76"/>
            <p>Conſider 1, <hi>The Reaſons why this ſhould be tried,</hi> and 2. <hi>A few helps how to perform it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All Communicants ſhould ſeriouſly examine the way of their own hearts, when they did Partake, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> It was our bleſſed Redeemer's way, after the firſt Celebration of this Sacrament, to ſet the Communicants in this Road of ſearching themſelves, whether they did then believe or not, <hi>Joh. 16. 31. Do ye now believe.</hi> This was demanded of them, when they had but lately riſen from the Lord's Table: and therefore is a queſtion that Communicants ought to put to themſelves, and obliged to have a ready Anſwer, as theſe Communicants had, which is the more to be noticed, that after they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared their Faith, <hi>ver.</hi> 30. Yet <hi>ver.</hi> 31. Chriſt urgeth it again that they may be deliberat, and know well what they ſay, when they ſay they believe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Our Communicating ſhould be carefully review<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, leſt we did eat and drink unworthily: otherwiſe we ſhal be found deſpiſers of that important warning, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 27. That ſuch as eat and drink unworthily, are <hi>guilty of the Body and Blood of the Lord.</hi> Men have neither a due fear of the anger of God, nor regard to their own ſouls who having partaken, think there is no more to be done, not ſo much as to enquire whether they came from the Lords Table guilty of his Body and Blood or not: for the beſt of men ſhould take notice of the great regard God hath to Sealing Ordinances. The <hi>Firſt</hi> thing we find Godly <hi>Hezekiah</hi> conſidering after the Celebration of the Paſſeover, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30. 18. Is the tranſgreſſion of the people, who did eat the Paſſeover otherwiſe than it was Written, for whom he prayed, and the Lord merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully anſwered his prayer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If the pains thou did take in preparation before Partaking was ſincere, that thou might have a bleſſed meeting with Chriſt, then the ſame principle will lead thee to enquire if he did meet with thy Soul: for no man can be ſaid to be earneſt for that which he will not ſo much as obſerve if it be found, if Communion with Chriſt was the deſire of thy Soul, then it will be thy deſire now
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:65303:77"/> to be ſecured of it, that thou may'ſt ſay, I ſought, and <hi>found him whom my ſoul loveth,</hi> Cant. 3, 4.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> If thou ſhalt find after ſearching, that thou did obtain real ſpiritual Communion with Chriſt, this will make thy Thankſgivings ſincere, this will be a mean to endear thy ſoul to Him, and increaſe thy Love, (which thou knoweſt hath need to be encreaſed) when thou has it to ſay, he came and manifeſted himſelf to thy Soul, did draw the in to his Fellowſhip, fed thee with the hidden Manna, whereby thy Soul was revived; canſt thou then but Love and ſeek to have thy heart enlarged for more Love? This will alſo endear thy heart to this holy Ordinance wherein thou found Him, this will make thee forward in ſeeking occaſions for it hereafter, becauſe there the Lord appeared unto thee. This will help thee to be a good example to others, who are negligent in ſeeking after it; this will be a mean to endear to thee the Promiſes, to thee the Lord promiſed to come and bleſs his people, where he recorded his Name, thou has found it even as he hath ſaid, his Words be true, now thou knoweſt it to be a meer Temptation to doubt of his Promiſe, or think that it faileth, now thou canſt ſay, I will no more diſtruſt any offer that Chriſt maketh of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to a poor Sinner, for as he offered, ſo I did embrace and am not diſappointed; now thou canſt Sing by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, as <hi>Pſal. 33. 21. For our heart ſhall rejoyce in him, becauſe we have truſted in his holy Name.</hi> Be perſwaded then, of the clearneſs and neceſſity of this Duty, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view thy work at the Lord's Table, that thou may'ſt know what to conclude of thy ſelf, whether thou may'ſt ſafely take comfort to thy Soul, as a ſincere and accepted Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municant or not: for a miſtake here is dangerous: if on the one hand thou judge thy ſelf a worthy Communicant, and thy ſelf but a ſtranger to Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this will harden thy heart in Sin, and render thee obſtinate againſt all neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary admonition, and reproof, and thus you may go on adding to your guilt at every Communion, and remain impenitent; ye, thinking it improper for you to repent for any ſinful Communicating, on the other hand, it's al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo dangerous for you to conclude your ſelves unworthy
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:65303:77"/> Communicants without ſure grounds, or ever ſearching into the matter: for thus you may deny the grace freely given you, and belie the operations of the holy Ghoſt, and thus ye may deny God the glory due to him for his mercies, and caſt your own ſouls into perplexing diquiet and bondage: therefore there is much need to be guided of God in this Search.</p>
            <p>And for the clearing of this a little: we are to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, both how it was with our Souls in the time of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating, and with what impreſſions and help, we come from that work, as for our work in the time of that Solemnity, albeit by the Word of God it may be declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed how Communicants ſhould act, and if they have ſo acted, then they are not unworthy Communicants: yet no man can diſcover the internal acts of other mens ſouls whether they have acted as they ſhould or not; none can know that but God, and mens own conſciences: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when ye are to try your ſincerity at the Lords Table, the Word of God muſt be your Rule, the ſpirit of God your Guide, and your own Conſcience a Witneſs; for the utmoſt that can be ſaid by men is Conditional, that is if you have acted ſuitable to the nature of the Work, if you have embraced Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then you are accepted and not unworthy Communicants. 2. VVhen Communicants are trying whether they have Communicated acceptablly, or Unworthily; they muſt diſtinguiſh between their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing helped to perform the Subſtance of the work then required, and having their Graces revived and elevated by the ſhining of God's Face upon them; becauſe a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever may ſincerely receive Chriſt Offered to him in the Sacrament when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ere is not ſuch lifting up of God's Countenance upon him as at other times, a Believer may be under ſome deſerved rebuke even at the Lord's Table, and yet he cleaveth to Chriſt, though hiding his face, and affectionatly Embraceth Him, though his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections be not raiſed to that hight that they have been and ſhould be. 3. There is great need of wiſdom from God, how to Judge of the paſſions of mens ſouls in time of communicating; for ſome men may have great flaſhes of Grief, or joy, at ſuch times, who know no
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:65303:78"/> ſuch thing at other times, or if they ſhould be ſo at other times, yet no better than the weeping of an <hi>Eſau,</hi> or the joy of an Hypocrite which ſoon periſheth: others again at the ſame work may have true Godly ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, melting down their hearts before the Lord in the Senſe of their ſin; and ſometimes the Joy of the Lord's true Spiritual comfort repleniſhing their fouls, ſo that they find it unſpeakable, and theſe elevated affections having a ſincere Root, flowing from indignation at ſin or Love to Chriſt are moſt deſireable; ſo that it ſhould or will be painful to a Believer if he find not ſome gale of affections; ſuitable in ſome meaſure to the love he is receiving, and publiſhing at the Lord's Table: nor will it abate his regard to theſe due affections, that an Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite may have the Counterfit of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Such Believers as doubt of their acceptance at the Lord's Table (which doubt doth often ariſe from people not being comforted at that time, or the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their graces not acting vigourouſly when they were Partaking) ſuch Communicants I ſay, for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting of diſponding diſquiet of mind, muſt in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viewing their work. Conſider if that which was indiſpenſably neceſſary was performed, that is the ſouls receiving of Chriſt as He is offered in the Goſpel, and offereth Himſelf to His people in that Ordinance, if the heart was opened for Him, and He embraced; then the moſt Subſtantial part of the VVork was performed: though there be Cauſe to Mourn that the affections were ſo low at ſuch enriching and Honourable work, yet Bleſs God if thou waſt enabled to Joyn thy ſelf to the Lord: for the Ordinance is not profaned; and though thou waſt a weak, yet not an unworthy Communicant. It may alſo contribute to thy Comfort, if when thou comeſt from the Lord's Table thou findeſt in thy Soul. <hi>Firſt</hi> an Inclination to Praiſe and Exalt thy Redeemer, and for this particularly that He did not utterly forſake thy ſoul, as thou knoweſt was deſerved; and though thou had a Rebuke by the hiding of His Face as to thy Comfort, yet thou ſubmits to it and does not ceaſe to love Him, knowing that He can make a Bleſſing of that froun, to
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:65303:78"/> render thee more humble and diligent for the time to come. 2. If thou find a deſire to hold faſt what thou haſt received: Thou art ſo far from having done with Chriſt, when thou has done at the Table, that thy heart cleaveth cloſe to Him; and ſo much the more if thou had any fear of His anger by withdrawing of His Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; if thou canſt not ſray from Him, but muſt have ſome renewed Teſtimony of His Love, fear of His anger being too heavy for thee to bear, <hi>Job 10. 2. Pſal.</hi> 80. 7.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> VVhen thou comes from the Lord's Table thou findeſt upon thy heart a fear of ſinning, that thy Lord be not provocked more; and this fear is of any manner of ſinning, ſo that there is no Trial or trouble thou feareſt ſo much as ſin, and ſo much the more becauſe thou thinkeſt thy ſin hath provocked thy God already, thy indignation is now raiſed againſt all ſin as thy greateſt Enemy, making thee long to be Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from Root and Branch of it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 24.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> If this thy Indignation at ſin, be Teſtifyed by thy watching againſt it, and all Temptations lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it, though it were as Plucking out of the Right Eye, if thou find thy heart Purified, then thou has the Faith of God's Elect, the cleanſing Vertue of Chriſt's Blood hath reached thy Soul, for nothing elſe could do it, 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 1. 19, 22.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> If thou comeſt from the Lord's Table with this fixed on thy heart, that from henceforth whatever come in thy way, thou wilt Believe, let the Difficulty be never ſo far above thy Strength, thou wilt Honour thy Redeemer by Truſting Him with any thing without exception; thou has now Profeſſed thy ſelf a Believer, before Angels and men, and by Grace thou wilt act as becometh a Believer: thou feareſt ſin, thou feareſt Temptations, thou wants not fear, that the Burden of ſome Trials is ready to breake thy Back: but now thou dare fear none of them with a faithleſs fainting fear, knowing thy Redeemer is Strong, and that thou art Solemnly Engaged to Truſt Him at all times. If this be the fruit of thy Communicating, then the Bond
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:65303:79"/> of the Covenant hath bound thy heart to thy Lord, then thy heart, beareth the Impreſſion of His Seal, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 52. 8.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Since thou came from the Lord's Supper; obſerve what Gracious alterations are to be found in thy Soul and Practice that were not found before: what thou can find of that exceeding great and Migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Power, whereby the Lord worketh in them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, if thou has not only brought Godly reſolutions from that Ordinance, but vertue and power, if thou can obſerve more of the Spirit of Power in thy Duties, if there be any obſervable new ſpring that decayed Graces are revived, if thy ſin be languiſhing, and Grace flowriſhing, if whatever Holy work thou art Engaged, in ſome vigour Life and ſtrength appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thou art not now deſiring to ſhift clear Duties, thy heart and thy work go now together, which often before were far aſunder; thou now takeſt delight in doing thy Lord's VVill, thou can run now and not weary as formerly; if this be found, then the Lord hath abundantly Bleſſed thy Proviſion, thy Meat hath been thy Bleſſing, and thou mayeſt now find it even as Chriſt ſaid, <hi>His fleſh Meat indeed, and His Blood Drink indeed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhal add but one word more to ſuch, as ſtill fear they did not Communicate acceptably even as to the very Subſtance of the work, and cannot ſay they Believed when they did Partake.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This Fear is very afflicting; but ſome who find not comfort at a Communion are ſo caſt down, and ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed in their apprehenſions, concluding the Lord hath diſerted them; that they can ſee nothing for their Comfort, and ſometimes refuſe to be comforted; having a ſtrange kind of pleaſure to harden themſelves in ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, though they did Believe in the time of Partaking; yet now they have not an eye to ſee it: No wonder the Lord be ſparing of His comforts to ſome people who ſo dote upon them, that the help of Grace is not ſo much valued, if they want Comfort: be not ſo proud as to think ye deſerve Comfort, nor ſo ignorant as to think the Lord is not free to diſpenſe Conſolations when He
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:65303:79"/> ſeeth fit, but not when ye think it fit; and learn to value the help of Grace more than Comfort by it ſelf, joy without Grace will deceive thee, therefore ſearch yet if any ſincerity can be found in thy Communicating, that thou mayeſt humbly and thankfully acknowledge it to His Praiſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> If after thou haſt again tryed it; yet thou canſt find no Faith in thy Communicating, thou art then to try if ever before that time thou didſt ſincerely Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Chriſt, receiving Him as thy Redeemer and Lord, for if it was ſo, the Union then made can never be Diſolved, <hi>For he that Believeth hath everlasting Life,</hi> John 3. 36. And by this Union, thou has an Intereſt in Grace to make thee Repent for ſinful Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 31.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If neither before Partaking, nor in the time, thou couldſt ſay thou ever Believed: Yet if thou ſhalt now Believe thou ſhalt be Saved, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 31. VVhat ever hath been thy Guilt, the Blood of Chriſt cleanſeth from all ſin.</p>

            <p>THIS Holy Ordinance being the Communion of Chriſt's Body and Blood: then Communicants are Oblidged to Live ſuitable to ſo great a Benefit, and teſtifie their Gratitude, by a Holy Walk and Converſation.</p>
            <p>The laſt thing to be Conſidered is, that after Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of our way in Communicating, if we did truely Partake the Communion of Chriſt's Body and Blood; we are to endeavour a Practice ſuitable thereunto; &amp; in order to this Holineſs of heart and Converſation.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> A brief hint of that Converſation required. 2. That our performance ſhould be early begun. 3. That Engagments and Vows be particularly performed. 4. That for Strengthening to the whole Work required, our begun Communion with God be cheriſhed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in that Holy walk which God hath Preſcribed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For the firſt, the Converſation required of us is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> To be blameleſs in all things, Phil. 2. 15. <hi>That ye may be blameleſs and harmleſs, the ſons of God, without rebuke.</hi> Stains on Communicants doth much ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the Progreſs of Religion and true Godlineſs; it ſhould grieve us much to be a Comfort to the wicked in their wickedneſs, <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 16. 54</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Walk in Him. Col. 2. 6. <hi>As ye have therefore received Chriſt Jeſus the Lord, ſo walk ye in him.</hi> What a wonderful walk is this, to walk in Chriſt! who can underſtand this if it be not given from above? yet they
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:65303:82"/> are the Words of God diſcovering our Duty, our Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge and our greateſt Help for this Holy Walk. 1. Our Duty ſtill to abide in Chriſt, never to go from Him, to any hand, to have all our way conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Communion with Chriſt, to admit willingly of nothing, but that which He will admit of in fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with Him; that ſo our fellowſhip may be continued. 2. Our Priviledge in partaking of ſo great Happineſs as to be Intereſted in His Favour, His love and care; and Bleſſed with ſuch nearneſs as to have Him for our Habitation, where we may live and walk at a Holy Liberty. 3. Here is our greateſt Help, and the very Fountain of it, if all ordinary Ciſterns were dried up, the Believer ſhal Live by the Fountain it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, becauſe Chriſt Lives, he who is in Him ſhal Live alſo: the Believer Liveth upon Chriſt and His Fullneſs, there he hath Grace to make him Love this Holy walk, and hold up his goings in it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Walk with God. Micah 6. 8. <hi>Walk humbly with thy God.</hi> Let none be ſo profane as to ſay are not theſe one? to walk in Him, and to walk with Him, and what need is there for Expreſſing this walk ſo many ways, for they are the Words of God and therefore all to be Regarded. This walking with God is a Teſtimony and Proof, of our being agreed with Him; otherwiſe there could be no walking with Him: For He <hi>putteth away all the wicked like droſs,</hi> Pſal. 119. 119. The Lord confereth this honour upon Believers, that being now reconciled by the Blood of Chriſt, they may draw near with ſome Holy confidence, and without Preſumption walk with their God: though it muſt be Humbl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, becauſe He is God, and we but duſt: nor is it poſſible to keep up this walk without Humility, for the proud in heart are an Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to Him: and the rareneſs of true humility maketh this walk ſo rare. 2. It's to walk with God, that is in His way, not in our ways; we muſt attend Him in His own ways not expecting to walk with Him in our ſinful ways: this is the more to be regarded, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we would willingly have God to be with us in our own way, to owne and countenance us, in the way of
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:65303:82"/> our own chuſing; when there is little care taken to be with God in his ways, but we cannot walk with Him out of His own way; and as we would have Him to be with us, ſo we ſhould take care that we be with Him, 2 Chr. 15. 2. <hi>The Lord is with you while ye be with Him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Walk before me, Gen. 17. 1. <hi>I am God Almighty, walk before Me and be thou perfect.</hi> 1. To walk as being under Gods al-ſeeing Eye, which is a great help to a Holy walk, labouring to do nothing but as being content God behold it, ſetting the Lord always before our eyes, or as the Apoſtle expreſſeth it, I forſaw the Lord always before my f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ce, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 22. Bleſſed is the man who frameth all his way for that Omniſcient Eye. 2. To walk before Him, is not only to be impreſſed with His diſcerning all our ways; but to ſet Him before our eyes as our all ſufficient God and help; Believing in our hearts that He can ſtrengthen, and bear us up in all the difficult ſteps of our walk. 3. To walk before Him or before His face, is to Encourage the Believer that not only God can help; but that His Eyes Mercifully upon His People, obſerving all their neceſſities and weakneſs, and the need they have that His Gracious Power be forth-coming to them; He hath them ſtill before His Face or Eyes: all which are ſtrengthening for this Holy walk, and keeping up Communion with God, yea this walking before Him in a Believing manner, is the way to bring us neareſt unto Perfection; walk before me and be thou perfect: and this ſhould be the Study of every Believer, to be always making Progreſs toward Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; the very endeavouring of it is alſo a great help to this Holy walk.</p>
            <p n="4">4. We are to walk after God, Deut. 13. 4. <hi>Ye ſhall walk after the Lord your God, and fear Him.</hi> This walking after Him is; that we may not miſtake our ſelves, by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geting our due diſtance, but underſtand that no Dignity, no Priviledge, no Intimacy granted ſhould make us forget what He is, and what we are; it's the Honour of His deareſt Children to be His Followers, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 1. <hi>2dly.</hi> We are here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by inſtructed that walking after Him, is to fear Him and keep His Commands; this muſt be in every ſtep of
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:65303:83"/> our walk, no pretence of a good Deſign, no Invention of our own without His Command, will agree with this walk. 3. When the Believer is admitted into true Fellowſhip with God, yet he is to follow on for greater nearneſs, and at the neareſt in this Life, is to follow for more; and the more near there is ſtill the more of theſe Infinit Excellencies Diſcovered, that maketh the Believer's Communion with God ſtill a following after Him. Phil. 3. 12. <hi>Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect, but I follow after.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. We muſt walk as Chriſt walked 1 John 2. 6. <hi>He that ſaith he abideth in Him, ought himſelf alſo ſo to walk, even as He walked:</hi> we muſt not ſhut our eyes, upon the Holineſs of this walk required in this Scripture, and muſt not throw it by, ſaying it's impoſſible for us to Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate Chriſt, O that prejudice againſt the holineſs of this walk, did not more obſtruct our Imitation, than that Chriſt's Practice was in many things Unimitable: for though it be true that no man is fooliſhly to preſume an Imitation in all things, or to attempt pure impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, yet it's no leſs true that we are Oblidged to learn by Chriſt's Practice and Example, wherein He is imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.
